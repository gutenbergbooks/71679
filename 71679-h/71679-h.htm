</div>


<p>When I brought out at the Vaudeville in 1896 my
play, entitled <i>Paméla, Marchande de Frivolités</i>, in which
I had grouped together dramatically, with what verisimilitude
I could, all the various Royalist attempts at
rescuing the son of Louis XVI., the Dauphin, from
the prison of the Temple, there were certain scholars
who found fault with me for representing an Englishwoman,
Lady Atkyns, as the protagonist, or at least
the prime mover in the matter of his escape. Some of
them went so far as to accuse me of having invented
this character for the purpose of my piece.</p>

<p>Lady Atkyns, certainly, has left but few traces of her
existence; she was a Drury Lane actress, pretty, witty,
impressionable, and good—it seems there were many
such among the English actresses of the time. Married
(we shall see presently how it came about) to a peer,
who gave her wealth at least, if not happiness, and who
does not appear to have counted for much in her life,
Lady Atkyns became a passionate admirer of Marie-Antoinette;
she was presented to the Queen at Versailles,
and when the latter was taken to the Temple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
the responsive Englishwoman made every effort to find
her way into the prison. She succeeded by the use of
guineas, which, in spite of the hatred professed for Pitt
and Coburg, were more to the taste of certain patriots
than the paper-money of the Republic.</p>

<p>Lady Atkyns suggested that the Queen should
escape dressed in her costume, but the Royal prisoner
would not forsake her children. There is a tradition
that in refusing the offer of her enthusiastic friend,
Marie-Antoinette besought her good offices for the
young Dauphin, while putting her on her guard against
the intrigues of the Comte de Provence and the Comte
d’Artois. However, most of these facts were still in
doubt, resting only on somewhat vague statements,
elliptical allusions, and intangible bits of gossip, picked
up here and there, when, one day, my friend Lenôtre,
who is great at ferreting out old papers, came to me,
all excitement, with a document which he had come
upon the evening before in a portfolio among the
Archives of the Police.</p>

<p>It was a letter, dated May, 1821, and addressed to
the Minister by the director of the penitential establishment
of Gaillon. This official was disturbed over the
proceedings of a certain “Madame Hakins or Aquins.”
Since the false Dauphin, Mathurin Bruneau, sentenced
by the Court of Rouen to five years’ imprisonment, had
become an inmate of that institution, this foreigner
had installed herself at Gaillon, and had been seeking
to get into communication with the prisoner. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
seemed even to be bent upon supplying him with the
means of making his escape.</p>

<p>I drew from this the obvious conclusion that if in
1821, Lady Atkyns could bring herself to believe in the
possibility of Mathurin Bruneau being the son of Louis
XVI., it must be because she had good reasons for being
convinced that the Dauphin had escaped from the
Temple. And this conviction of hers became of considerable
importance because of the <i>rôle</i> she herself had
played (however little one knew of it) in the story of
the Royal captivity.</p>

<p>It was quite clear that after her promise to the
Queen, the faithful Englishwoman, who, as we have
seen, was not afraid to compromise herself, and who was
generous with her money, must have kept in touch at
least with all the facts relating to the Dauphin’s
imprisonment, learning all that was to be learnt about
the Temple, questioning everybody who could have
had any contact with the young captive—warders,
messengers, doctors, and servants. If after such investigations,
and in spite of the official records and of
the announcement of his death on June 9, 1798, she
could still believe twenty-six years later that the prince
might be alive, it can only be because she was satisfied
that the dead youth was not the Dauphin.</p>

<p>Had she herself got the Dauphin out of prison?
Or had she merely had a hand in the rescue? By what
process of reasoning had she been able to persuade
herself that an adventurer such as this Bruneau, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
imposture was manifest, could be the Dauphin? Why,
if she believed that the Prince had been carried away
from the Temple, had she kept silence so long? If
this was not her belief, why did she interest herself in
one of those who had failed most pitifully in the impersonation
of the prince? Lenôtre and I could find
no answer to all these questions. To throw light upon
them, it would have been necessary to undertake minute
researches into the whole life of Lady Atkyns, following
her about from place to place, learning where she lived
during the Revolution, ascertaining the dates of all her
sojourns in Paris, studying all the facts of her existence
after 1795, together with the place and date of her
death, the names of her heirs, the fate of her correspondence
and other papers—a very laborious piece of
work, still further complicated by the certainty that it
would be necessary to start out upon one’s investigations
in England. We did not abandon all idea of the task,
however; but time lacked—time always lacks!—and
we talked of it as a task that must wait for a year of
leisure, knowing only too well that the year of leisure
would never come.</p>

<p>Chance, upon which we should always count, settled
the matter for us. Chance brought about a meeting
between Lenôtre and a young writer, just out of the
École des Chartes, M. Frédéric Barbey, very well
informed, both through his earlier studies and through
family connections, concerning what it is customary to
designate “la Question Louis XVII.” M. Barbey had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
the necessary leisure, and he was ready to undertake
any kind of journey that might be entailed; he revelled
in the idea of the difficulties to be coped with in what
would be to him an absorbing task. Lenôtre introduced
him to me, and I felt certain from the first that the
matter was in good hands. M. Barbey, in truth, is
endowed with all the very rare qualities essential to
this kind of research—a boundless patience, the <i>flair</i> of
a collector, the <i>aplomb</i> of an interviewer, complete
freedom from prejudice, and the indomitable industry
and ardent zeal of an apostle.</p>

<p>M. Barbey set out for England at once, and came
back a fortnight later, already possessed of a mass of
valuable information regarding the early life of our
English Royalist, including this specific item: Lady
Atkyns died in Paris, in the Rue de Lille, in 1836.
An application to the <i>greffe de paix</i> of the <i>arrondissement</i>
resulted in M. Barbey’s obtaining the name of the
notary who had the drawing up of the deeds of succession.
At the offices of the present courteous possessor
of the documents, after any amount of formalities
and delays and difficulties, over which his untiring
pertinacity enabled him to triumph, he was at last
placed in possession of an immense pile of dusty papers,
which had not been touched for nearly seventy years:
the entire correspondence addressed to Lady Atkyns
from 1792 down to the time of her death.</p>

<p>That was a red-letter day! From the very first
letters that were looked at, it seemed that henceforth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
all doubts would be at an end: the Royal youth had
assuredly been carried away from the Temple! Between
the lines, beneath all the studiously vague and discreet
wording of the correspondence, we were able to follow,
in one letter after another, all the plotting and planning
of the escape, the anxieties of the conspirators, the precautions
they had to take, the disappointments, the
treacheries, the hopes.... At last, we were on the
threshold of the actual day of the escape! Another
week would find us face to face with the Dauphin!
Three days more...! To-morrow...! Alas! our
disappointment was great—almost as great as that of
Lady Atkyns’s fellow-workers. The boy never came
into their hands. <i>Did</i> he escape? Everything points
to his having done so, but everything points also to
his having been spirited away out of their hands just
as he was being embarked for England, where Lady
Atkyns awaited feverishly the coming of the child she
called her King—her King to whose cause she made
her vows, but on whose face she was destined probably
never to set eyes, and whose fate was for ever to remain
to her unknown.</p>

<p>Such is the story we are told in this book of Frédéric
Barbey’s—a painful, saddening, exasperating story,
extracted (is it necessary to add?) from documents of
incontestable authenticity, now made use of for the first
time.</p>

<p>But can it be said to satisfy fully our curiosity?
Is it the last word on this baffling “Question Louis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
XVII.,” the bibliography of which runs already to
several hundreds of volumes? Of course not! The
record of Lady Atkyns’s attempts at rescuing the Prince
is a singularly important contribution to the study of
the problem, but does not solve it. What became of
the boy after he was released? Was this boy that they
released the real Prince, or is there question of a substitute
already at this stage? Did Marie-Antoinette’s
devoted adherent succeed merely in being the dupe of
the people in her pay? At the period of her very first
efforts, may not the Dauphin have been already far from
the Temple—hidden away somewhere, perhaps gone
obscurely to his death, in the house of some disreputable
person to whom his identity was unknown? For must
we not place some reliance upon the assertions of the
wife of Simon the shoemaker, who declared she had
carried off the Prince at a date seven months earlier
than the first steps taken by Lady Atkyns? It is all
a still insoluble problem, the most complex, the most
difficult problem that the perspicacity of historians
has ever been called upon to solve.</p>

<p>The most important result of this new study is
that it relegates to the field of fiction the books of
Beauchesne, Chantelauze, La Sicotière, and Eckart
among others; that it disproves absolutely the assertions
of the official history of these events—the assertion that
there is no room for doubt that the Dauphin never left
his cell, that he lived and suffered and died there. Henceforward,
it is an established fact, absolutely irrefutable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
that during nearly five months, from November, 1794,
to March, 1795, the child in the jailer’s hands was not
the son of Louis XVI., but a substitute, and mute.
How did this deception end? Was the issue what was
expected? The matter is not cleared up; but that
this substitution of the Prince was effected is now
beyond dispute, and this revelation, instead of throwing
light upon the impenetrable obscurity of the drama,
renders it still more dense. This mute boy substituted
for the boy in prison, who was himself possibly but a
substitute; these sly and foolish guardians who succeed
to each other, muddling their own brains and mystifying
each other; these doctors who are called to the bedside
of the dying Prince, and who, like Pelletan, long afterwards
invent stories about his death-bed sufferings—though
at the actual time of his death they were either
so careless or so cunning as to draw up an unmeaning
<i>procès-verbal</i>, as to the bearing of which commentators
for more than a century have been unable to agree;—all
these official statements which establish nothing; the
interment recorded in three separate ways by the three
functionaries who were witnesses; the obvious, manifest,
admitted doubt, which survived in the minds of Louis
XVIII. and the Duchesse d’Angoulême; the manœuvres
of the Restoration Government, which could so easily
have elucidated the question, and which, by <i>maladresse</i>
or by guilefulness, made it impenetrable, by removing
the most important documents from the national
archives; finally, the foolish performances of the fifteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
or so lying adventurers who attempted to pass themselves
off as so many dauphins escaped from the Temple,
and each of whom had his devoted adherents, absolutely
convinced of his being the real prince, and whose absurd
effusions, when not venal, combine to produce the effect
of an inextricable maze; these were the factors of the
“Question Louis XVII.” The worst of it all is that
one must overlook no detail: it is only by disproving
and eliminating that we can succeed in bringing out
isolated facts—solid, indisputable facts that shall serve
as stepping-stones to future revelations.</p>

<p>It is necessary to study, scrutinize, and reflect. One
opinion alone is to be condemned as indubitably wrong:
that of the historians who see nothing in all this worthy
of investigation and of discussion, to whom the story of
the Dauphin is all quite clear and intelligible, and who
go floundering about over the whole ground with the
calm serenity of the blind, assured of the freedom of
their road from obstruction, and that they cannot see
the obstacles in their way. Frédéric Barbey’s work
unveils too many incontestable facts of history for
it to be possible henceforth for any one to see in
this marvellous enigma nothing but fantasies and
inventions.</p>

</div>


<p>To tell once again the oft-told story of Queen Marie-Antoinette;
to go over anew all the familiar episodes of
her sojourn at the Tuileries, her captivity in the Temple,
her appearance before the Revolutionary tribunal, and
her death; to append some hitherto undiscovered detail
to the endless piles of writings inspired by these events,
and in our turn sit in judgment alike upon her conduct
and the conduct of her enemies, and, as a natural
sequence, upon the Revolution, its work and its issues:
to do any or all of these things has not been our intention.</p>

<p>This book has a less ambitious aim—that of restoring
the picture of a woman, a foreigner, who was brought
by chance one day to Versailles on the eve of the
catastrophe, whom the Queen honoured with her friendship,
and who knew no rest until she had expended all
her energy and all her wealth in efforts to procure the
liberty not only of Marie-Antoinette herself, but of
those belonging to her. How Lady Atkyns set out
upon her project, whom she got to help her, what
grounds for hope she had, and what hindrances and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
disappointments she experienced, the degrees of success
and of failure that attended all her attempts—these are
the matters we have sought to deal with.</p>

<p>In the maze of her plots and plans, necessarily
mixed up with the enterprises of the <i>émigrés</i> and of
the agents of the counter-revolution—up above the
network of all these machinations within France and
without—one luminous point shines forth always as
the goal of every project: the tower of the Temple.
All around the venerable building strain and struggle
the would-be rescuers of its prisoners. Its name, now
famous, instils into the Royalist world something of
the terror that went forth of old from the Bastille.
What went on exactly inside the dungeon from 1792
to 1795? The question, so often canvassed by contemporaries,
is still where it was, crying out for an
answer. However hackneyed may seem the matter of
the Dauphin’s imprisonment, we have not felt warranted
in deliberately avoiding it. Had we been so minded
when embarking upon this study (the voluminous
bibliography of the subject is calculated to discourage
the historian!), we should in any case have been
forced into its investigation by a heap of hitherto
unpublished documents which we unearthed.</p>

<p>This leads us to the enumeration of the sources
whence we have drawn the materials for our work.</p>

<p>All that has been hitherto known of Lady Atkyns
amounts to very little. M. de la Sicotière, coming
upon her name in the course of his study of the life of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
Louis de Frotté, refers to her merely in a brief note,
necessarily incomplete.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Four years later, M. V.
Delaporte, on the occasion of the centenary of Marie
Antoinette, published in his <i>Études</i> a correspondence
in which the name of the Queen’s English friend repeatedly
appeared. These papers caught our attention.
Under the friendly guidance of M. Delaporte we sought
to recover the papers which Lady Atkyns left behind
her on her death. In the course of systematic researches,
into the nature of which we need not enter here, we
were enabled by an unlooked-for piece of good luck to
lay hands upon the entire collection of Lady Atkyns’s
correspondence, covering her whole life. This correspondence,
docketed and arranged by the notary entrusted
with the regulating of the affairs of the deceased,
was found lying in the archives of the notary’s study,
where, by the permission of the present owner of the
documents, I was able to consult them.</p>

<p>The letters are all originals. Some of them, of
which copies had been made by some one unidentified,
had been destined probably for use in supporting claims
put forward by Lady Atkyns. Many letters, unfortunately,
are missing, having been confided by the too
trustful lady to members of the Royal Household or
to Louis XVIII. himself.</p>

<p>To know what value to attach to these letters, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
necessary to know something about the writers. Apart
from General Louis de Frotté, who has been made the
subject of a detailed biography, the characters mixed
up with Lady Atkyns’s adventures appear for the first
time upon the stage of history.</p>

<p>The <i>Archives Nationales</i>, and those of the Ministry
for War and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, enable us
to recall these forgotten worthies with sufficient accuracy.
We have made use in the same way of the Municipal
Archives of Dunkerque in our account of the flight of
the Chevalier de Conterne and his companion out of the
kingdom; of the Archives of Lille; and of the Archives
of the Grand Duchy of Baden, preserved at Carlsbad.</p>

<p>This bald enumeration suffices to indicate the spirit
in which our task has been conceived and carried out.
In a question such as this, obscured and confused by
any number of dubious second-hand and third-hand
testimonies and untrustworthy narratives, it was
necessary to get hold of absolutely irrefutable documents.
Letters from contemporaries seemed to us to
fulfil better than anything else the conditions thus imposed.
They have made it possible for us to supplement
in large measure the information acquired from
the Archives of the State: many of these letters are
derived from private family archives which have most
generously been placed at our disposal.</p>

<p>Thanks to these friendly helpers, we have succeeded
in completing a task undertaken in a spirit of filial
affection. We cannot forget her who guided and took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>
part in our researches and helped with her sympathy
and encouragement. To her it is that we must make
our first acknowledgment of indebtedness, and then
to the historian to whom this book is inscribed, and
whose valued and assiduous help we have never lacked.</p>

<p>We have to express our gratitude also to all those
who have helped us with their advice and good offices:

<p>At dawn, on April 7, 1790, a singular disturbance
was going on in the streets of Lille. In the northern
districts, not far from the citadel, troops of soldiers
stood all along the avenues, filled the squares, ransacked
the courtyards of the houses. Shots went off
every instant, and the extraordinary thing was that
this fusillade from the soldiers was directed against
other soldiers. In the midst of the smoke, the deafening
noise, and the cries of the awakened townsfolk,
were to be seen the blue uniforms, with sky-blue facings,
of the Regiment of the Crown, one of the four quartered
in the garrison.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>
<p>Every horseman who appeared was greeted with
successive volleys; evidently the combat was to the
death between the light cavalry of Normandy, who
charged upon the pavements or fought on foot with
their muskets, and the grenadiers of the Crown and of
the Royal-Vaisseaux.</p>

<p>Moreover, there was no order in this street-fight.
The officers on both sides were absent, and if by any
chance some <i>had</i> been present, the excitement and
anger visible upon the assailants’ faces were a proof
that their intervention would have been useless.</p>

<p>Riot, in fact, was reigning in the city of Lille, the
capital of the province; and this time law and order
were being upset by those whose duty it was to make
them respected. But the town, with its 80,000 inhabitants,
had for months been going, nervously and anxiously,
through a succession of anything but encouraging
episodes. The convocation of the States General, the
formation of the Garde Nationale, the creation of the
Municipality, and, two months earlier (in February),
the administrative upset which thrilled the province—all
this, added to the distress of the kingdom, to the
general misery, to the exaggerated price of food, and
to the ruin of commerce, had brought about several
outbreaks in this manufacturing town, naturally dependent
upon its trade for its well-being. And, at the
very moment that there came from Paris the most
alarming news—that is, on April 29, 1789 (coinciding
almost day for day with the sacking of the Reveillon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
factory) pillage had its first innings at Lille also; the
bakeries were invaded; and three months later four
houses were attacked by the mob and burnt down.</p>

<p>Of the troops which then composed the garrison of
Lille, one part had taken up their quarters in the town;
these were the regiments of the Crown and of the
Royal-Vaisseaux. The other, consisting of the light
cavalry of Normandy and the infantry of Colonel-General,
the leading French regiment, were lodged at
the citadel, that imposing fortress which is Vauban’s
masterpiece. Certain signs of insubordination had crept
into the two former regiments; the revolutionary spirit
was working actively in the men, and was favoured by
the permanent contact with the inhabitants in which
these two regiments lived. More remote from this influence,
away off in the citadel, the “Colonel-Generals”
cherished sentiments of whole-hearted devotion to the
King; moreover, they had over them a body of officers
whose unadulterated royalism was to display itself in
the events which we shall now endeavour to set forth.
As matters were, the least thing would let loose these
warring elements in the garrison upon one another.
And what finally did it? A mere nothing, a scuffle
that broke out on the evening of April 8, between the
chasseurs and the grenadiers—some say a duel. At any
rate, two soldiers were killed on the spot.... Instantly
cavalry and infantry take sides for their respective
comrades. During the night a general attack is
talked of, on both sides. The officers get wind of it;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
but, unluckily, two of the colonels are on leave. The
Marquis de Livarot, commandant of the province, tries
to restore peace by holding a meeting of delegates from
each corps; he believes he has succeeded, but scarcely
has he left them when the fusillade breaks out again in
every direction.</p>

<p>The “Colonel-Generals” had remained neutral until
then; discipline, so carefully maintained by the commanding
officers, had prevailed with the men. But
when, in the evening, they saw the <i>chasseurs</i> of Normandy
falling back on the citadel for refuge, these
their comrades of the infantry opened the gates to
them, brought them in and joined cause with them,
refusing any longer to listen to their officers, who still
strove for peace. They carried things, indeed, even
further than that. M. de Livarot and M. de Montrosier—that
last lieutenant of the King—on coming out
of the gate which led into the square, saw that they
were surrounded by a group of mutineers, whose attitude
was menacing. Despite the efforts of the few officers
who were present, these two were dragged into a casemate,
where their situation was simply that of prisoners.</p>

<p>During this time the most sinister rumours were circulating
in the town, kept alive by the infantry of the
Crown and the Royal-Vaisseaux regiments. People
expected nothing less than to see the cannons of the
citadel open their throats and vomit down grape-shot
on the populace. Shortly, on the walls of the houses
and in the <i>cafés</i>, the uneasy citizens might read a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
strange proclamation, at the authorship of which all the
world could guess. It opened with this apostrophe:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Let us beware, Citizens</span>,</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LET US BEWARE</span>,</p>

<p><i>and thrice: Let us beware</i>. We are deceived, we are betrayed, we
are sold!... But we are not yet ruined; we have our weapons!
<i>The infernal Fitz-James</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is gone with all his crew ... they have
contented themselves with keeping back a useless lot.</p>

<p>“<i>Livaro, the infamous Livaro</i>, is said to be in our citadel; <i>Montrosier</i>,
the atrocious author of all our ills, sleeps peacefully.</p>

<p>“The soldiers, whom they have tried to corrupt, offer these men
to us.... What are we waiting for? Why do we not show all
France that we are <i>Citizens</i>, that we are <i>Patriots</i>? Is it for the
orders of our Commandant that we look? But has not the <i>aristocrat</i>
of <i>Orgères</i> already shown us how unworthy he is of the place which
we have blindly entrusted to him?... He commands us only that
he may lead us into the abyss. Seconded by his sycophant, <i>Carette</i>,
and by the traitors whom our cowardice leaves in command over
us; leagued with the heads of all the aristocratic intrigues, he now
seeks to alienate from us our brave comrades of the Crown, and of
Royal-des-Vaisseaux. Shall we let them go? No; ... but we will
march with them.... We will go and seize <i>Livarot</i>, <i>Montrosier</i>,
and deliver them up, bound hand and foot, to the utmost severity of
the august National Assembly!</p>

<p>“Why are not our conscript Fathers convoked? Is the General
Council of the Commune a mere phantom? Is the blood of our
citizens less precious than vile pecuniary interests? Would not our
secret enemies flinch before the enlightenment and the patriotism of
our Notables? <i>Ah! Citizens! Let us beware, and once more let us
beware!</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>At an extraordinary meeting at the Maison de Ville,
the Municipality had convoked the General Council;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
and, in the interval they received a deputation from the
troops of the citadel, assuring the inhabitants of Lille of
their good intentions: “The regiments of the Colonel-General,
and of the Chasseurs de Normandie” (said the
envoys) “protest to the townsfolk that it has never
entered into their heads to cause the least alarm to the
citizens, of whom until now they have known nothing
that was not admirable;” and they also announced that
two delegates had been sent to Paris, on a mission to
the National Assembly and to the King.</p>

<p>The whole night went by, and no solution had been
found. Towards four o’clock the two regiments which
had stayed in town were about to leave it on the persuasion
of the town councillors; but the City Guard
would not let them go, and thus, on the morning of
April 10, the same difficulties had to be faced anew.
But this situation could not continue. Messengers
are despatched to Paris, and with them are sent denunciators
of the “infamous” Livarot, whose conduct is
considered suspicious; and for eight days he is kept
under surveillance at the citadel, in defiance of the
Royal authority with which he is invested.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the officer delegated by the “Colonel-Generals”
was making his way to Paris. Despite the
importance of the mission, it was a young lieutenant
who had been chosen for it; but the coolness he had
shown all through the episode, and his determined and
energetic attitude, had designated him at once as the
man to be selected. Louis de Frotté was born at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Alençon on August 5, 1766.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Of noble lineage (his
family had been established in Normandy since the
fifteenth century), he had inherited the sentiments of
duty and fidelity to his King and of devotion to that
King’s cause. Left motherless at the age of six,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> educated
first at Caen, then at Versailles, in the school of
Gorsas,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he had entered as supernumerary sub-lieutenant,
in 1781, the regiment of “Colonel-General,”
then garrisoned at Lille. The young officer attracted
every one by his generous, liberal, and affectionate
character, and by his strong sense of comradeship. It
was in the regiment that he contracted those solid
friendships which were afterwards so beneficial to him,
such, for instance, as that of the Prince de la Tremoïlle,
and of a Norman gentleman named Vallière.</p>

<p>A short stay at Besançon had broken up the long
months in garrison at Lille; then he had returned to that
town, where the disturbances of which we are speaking
had come to diversify the somewhat monotonous way
of existence which is inseparable from garrison life.</p>

<p>Filled with hope for the result of his mission, Frotté
rode swiftly to Paris. The prospect of seeing the King,
of narrating to him, as well as to the War Minister, Le
Tour du Pin, the recent occurrences at Lille, of assuring
him of the fidelity of the regiment, of obtaining some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
tolerably satisfactory solution of the critical situation—all
this was spurring on our cavalier. And the thought
of soon getting back to Lille, his mission crowned with
success, of reappearing before certain eyes to which he
was not insensible—everything combined to make him
forget the length of the journey.</p>

<p>His stay at Paris was a short one. The future chief
of the <i>chouans</i> of Normandy realized one of his greatest
wishes in being admitted to an audience with the King;
but the position of the Royal Family in the midst of
the prevailing effervescence of feeling, and the atmosphere
of hostility which surrounded them, filled his
heart with foreboding thoughts. Burning with devotion,
powerless to make valid offers to the King, Frotté—who
had suggested the bringing together at Lille of a
nucleus of reliable troops, absolutely to be trusted—regained
the garrison at the end of a few days, for it
had been made clear to him that Louis XVI. did not
wish to share in his youthful ardour and its projects.
He had, however, succeeded thoroughly in the official
part of his task. When confronted with a deputation
from the hostile regiments of the Crown and of the
Royal-Vaisseaux, who came in their turn to plead their
cause, the representative of the Colonel-Generals had
been able to cope with them in defence of his own
interests; he came back, bringing with him an order
for the alteration of the whole garrison. The Colonel-Generals
were transferred to Dunkirk, the three others
were sent out of the province. As to the unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Marquis de Livarot, who was still a prisoner at the
citadel, a mandate from the Minister summoned him
to Paris, there to answer for his conduct. Needless to
say, he cleared himself of every accusation, and was
entirely rehabilitated.</p>

<p>Frotté did not spend in idleness the few days which
preceded the departure of his regiment. Besides the
ordinary arrangements—the giving up of his place of
abode, the packing of his affairs, the paying of his
debts; besides the friends to whom he had to bid farewell;
in short, besides the thousand ties that are contracted
during a stay of nine years in a town which is
not among the smallest in the kingdom, there was, in
the Rue Princesse, at a few minutes’ walk from the
citadel, a one-storeyed house of unimposing exterior,
whose door had often opened to receive the young
officer. The prospect of not returning there for a long
time filled his heart with distress and regret. For
some months this house had been inhabited by a
foreigner, an English lady, who had come to Lille with
a reputation for grace and beauty which had proved
to be not unmerited. At that time there was already
in Lille quite a colony of English people, who were
attracted there either by the proximity of their own
country and the closeness of Paris, or by the commercial
prosperity of the place and its numerous industries. In
the census returns of the town at the beginning of the
Revolution, and also in the taxation assessments, we
have come across many names of evident British origin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
But the remarkable thing about the new-comers at the
Rue Princesse, was that they had not arrived from
England, but from Versailles. They were very soon
received by the best society of Lille, and questions
began to circulate about them, every one trying to penetrate
a certain mystery which hung about their past life.</p>

<p>Let us, in our turn, attempt to lift the veil, and to
find out something about the English lady who is to be
the heroine of this work.</p>

<p>Charlotte Walpole, who was born probably about
1758,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> bore a name that in the United Kingdom is
illustrious among the illustrious. Was she a direct
descendant of Sir Robert Walpole, Earl of Oxford, the
celebrated statesman who administered English politics
for some years under George I.? It is difficult to
ascertain.</p>

<p>The youngest of three daughters,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Charlotte probably
passed all her youth in the county of Norfolk, the cradle
of her family, under that gloomy sky, in that ever-moist
climate, in the midst of those emerald green pastures
which make that part of England one of the great agricultural
districts. The tranquil, melancholy charm of
the scenery there, the immense flocks of sheep and goats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
browsing in the pastures, the wide horizon, unlimited
except by the heavy clouds which hang eternally over
the land—all this fastened upon the imagination of the
girl, naturally of a very enthusiastic temperament, and
developed in her that indefinable charm which struck all
who knew her. Her large eyes, enhanced by very
marked eyebrows, had an infinitely sweet expression.
The only existing portrait of her depicts her with her
hair dressed in the fashion of the time—her dark curls
lightly tied with a slender ribbon, and falling back, carelessly,
on her forehead. She had a most original mind,
a face which changed and lit up with every passing mood,
and an expression all her own, which made her, as it
were, a unique personality. All this is enough explanation
of why, at nineteen, Charlotte Walpole went to
London, with the idea of making use of her talents on
the stage.</p>

<p>The capital of England could then boast of only
three theatres, of which the most frequented, Drury
Lane, which ranked as Theatre Royal, is still in existence,
and preserves intact its ancient reputation. It
was there that, on October 2, 1777, at the opening of
the theatrical season, Miss Walpole made her first appearance
in a piece called <i>Love in a Village,</i><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a comedy
probably in the same <i>genre</i> as those of O’Keefe, and
then very much to the public taste, which was growing
weary of the brutal and licentious farces of the preceding
centuries. Five days later Miss Walpole reappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
in <i>The Quaker,</i> and the week after she was seen in the
<i>role</i> of “Jessica” in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, one of
Shakespeare’s masterpieces. After having played, in the
spring of 1778, in <i>The Waterman</i>, her success seemed
assured; on May 2, <i>Love in a Village</i> was given again
for her benefit, and she then filled to perfection the part
of “Rosetta”; the season terminated ten days later with
a representation of <i>The Beggars’ Opera</i>, by John Gay.
There can be no doubt that the young actress had found
her vocation, and that, moreover, with the consent of
her family. But, as a matter of fact, there did not
then prevail in England the sort of disfavour that so
often attaches to a theatrical career in a certain set of
society. Miss Walpole’s experience is a proof of this.
During the summer, which she most probably spent in
the country, she sought to cultivate her talents, and so
well did she succeed that in the season, which reopened
on September 15, 1778, she was seen again in London,
eager to gather fresh laurels. This time she appeared
in costume, in a sort of operetta entitled <i>The Camp</i>,
which had a tremendous success all that winter. The
piece, an imitation of Sheridan by Tickell, represented
the arsenal and the camp at Coxheath, and Miss Walpole,
as “Nancy,” took the part of a young soldier, and
filled it most admirably, a contemporary author informs
us.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> We have found an engraving which represents her
in this costume, doubtless a souvenir of the plaudits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
which she then received. In the month of April, 1779,
she appears again in other pieces by Farquhar. After
this, the bills for us have nothing to say; Miss
Walpole’s name is not to be found in them.</p>

<p>To what must one attribute this sudden silence, this
disappearance from the stage, just when so fair a future
seemed opening before the actress? To a determination
brought about by her very success itself and by the
charm she exercised. Several times during the winter
a young man had been seen at Drury Lane, who
occupied a front stall and watched very keenly the
acting of the graceful young recruit of Coxheath;
so that there was no very great astonishment expressed
when, on June 18, 1779, <i>The Gentleman’s Magazine</i>,
in its society column, announced the marriage of Sir
Edward Atkyns with Miss Charlotte Walpole, of the
Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> “The pretty Miss
Atkyns”—that was henceforth to be her appellation in
London, and all over Norfolk!</p>

<p>If the Walpoles could boast of an illustrious descent,
the Atkyns’ in this respect were in no wise inferior to
them. In this family, where the Christian names are
handed down from generation to generation, that of
Edward is, as it were, immutable! Illustrious personages
are by no means wanting. An Atkyns had been
Chancellor of the Exchequer in the seventeenth century;
his son had built a splendid manor-house, Ketteringham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
in the same county of Norfolk; at his death he left it
to his grand-nephew, who, in his turn, bequeathed it
to the fortunate husband of Miss Walpole.</p>

<p>The young couple took up their abode in this antique
mansion of Ketteringham Hall, the name of which will
often recur in this narrative. They appear to have
lived peacefully there for some years, coming only for
a few weeks in mid-winter to London. “Happy is
the nation that has no history,” says the proverb; and
it is equally true that happy folk have none. So we
will certainly not, in the absence of any material, create
one for these young people.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is well to mention the account given
of them by a friend of our heroine, the Countess MacNamara,
who seems to have been very well acquainted
with the different particulars of her life. She tells us
that the young couple, who, if we are to believe her,
had not many friends in England, decided to go to the
Continent, and live at Versailles.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> (The explanation
does not seem a very plausible one.) There the charm
of the young wife, her pretty voice, the receptions which
she soon began to give, and to which, thanks to her
husband’s wealth, she was able to lend so much brilliancy,
opened to her quickly the doors of all the society
connected with the Court. In the Queen’s set, the
beautiful Duchess de Polignac, in particular, took a great
fancy to this graceful foreigner; and was desirous, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
her turn, to make her known to her august friend.
Thus it came about that Lady Atkyns was introduced
into the circle of Marie-Antoinette’s intimates. Even
more completely than the others, the new-comer fell
under the Queen’s spell. A current of ardent sympathy
established itself between the two women. They were
united by a deep and intimate mutual comprehension
and sympathy. For any one who knew Lady Atkyns,
it was certain that these first impressions would not fade,
but that they would prove to be, on the contrary, the
first-fruits of an unalterable friendship. These are the
only materials one has for the details of that sojourn at
Versailles. When exactly did the Atkynses resolve upon
this move? Their only child, a son, must have been
born before it took place. What were their plans in
coming to the Court? All these are insoluble problems.</p>

<p>They were probably at Versailles when the first
revolutionary troubles broke out. They were present,
perhaps, at the opening of the States General, that
great national function; and they were among those
who shuddered at the taking of the Bastille. When
the October days brought back the Royal family in a
mournful procession to Paris, the young couple were
already gone—already too far away to enter into the
anxieties and sufferings of those whom they loved.</p>

<p>A brief mention, a few words found after patient
research, in dusty registers, tell us enough to make us
certain of their fate. This is one of the joys of the
explorer in this sort—to find buried under the waste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
of years of accumulated official papers, a feeble light, a
tiny, isolated indication, which opens, none the less, an
infinite horizon before him.</p>

<p>In the autumn of the year 1789, an Englishwoman,
named by the officials charged with the collection of a
special poll-tax, Milady Charlotte, arrived at Lille with
one servant.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In December, she installed herself in the parish of
St. André, in a house in the Rue Princesse, then numbered
337, which belonged to a gentleman named De Drurez.
Of her husband there is no mention, nor is her surname
given. Probably she had stayed some time at an inn,
before settling down in Rue Princesse; but what is to
be concluded from so vague an appellation as “Milady
Charlotte”? Why did she conceal half her name?
Nevertheless, at Lille there is some information to be
had about her. We know that she was pensioned upon
the Royal Treasury, since she is described as a French
pensioner.</p>

<p>In the following year she increases her establishment,
keeping one more servant; her poll-tax, which
had been 14 louis, now rises to 16. We may add here
that, in order to satisfy our curiosity, we have examined—but
in vain—the lists of the pensioners from the Royal
Treasury at that period; there is no mention anywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
either of Milady Charlotte or of Lady Atkyns—not
even in those which relate to the Queen’s household.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>By what right did she enjoy this pension? By the
same, probably, as so many of those favoured folk whose
names fill the famous <i>red-books</i>—the books whose publication
was to let loose the fury of the half of France
upon the Court and the nobility, because they showed
so plainly what treasures had been swallowed up in
that abyss.</p>

<p>As we have said, the documents say nothing of the
presence of Edward Atkyns at Lille—nothing, that is,
with one exception, which, delicate as it is, cannot be
passed over in silence. Had disunion already crept
into the household? Had the pretty girl from Drury
Lane found out too late that he to whom she had given
her heart and her life was no longer entirely worthy of her
gifts? Perhaps. At any rate, on March 20, 1791, the
curate of the parish of St. Catherine at Lille baptized a
male child, son “of Geneviève Leglen, native of Lille,”
whose father declared himself to be Edward Atkyns.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Henceforth this last individual disappears completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
from the scene in which we are interested; we shall
merely learn that in 1794 Charlotte Atkyns was left a
widow.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This somewhat lengthy digression was necessary in
order to portray the lady whom Frotté was to designate
as “That heroic and perfect being,” and who was to
take such a hold upon his life. How did they become
acquainted? Probably very quickly, in one of the
numerous drawing-rooms where Lille society congregated,
at balls, at the theatre, in the concert-hall. The
white tunic, with red facings, of the “Colonel-Generals”
was eagerly welcomed everywhere. As one of his
friends wrote to Frotté: “All the decent people in the
town will be delighted to see the uniform, if you wear
it there!” And one can imagine the long talks that
the young officer had with his fair friend in that winter
of ’89—talks that circled always around one precious
topic. Already full of Royalist feeling, Frotté grew
enthusiastic for the Queen’s cause, as he listened to the
stories about Versailles, to the reminiscences of her
kindness, her charm, her affectionate ways—of the
thousand characteristics, so faithfully recounted by the
friend who had come under her influence.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>
<p>One can divine all the advice, all the prudent counsels
which were impressed upon our young lieutenant on his
departure for Paris. Everything combined to make
him eager to offer his services to the King and his
belongings. We have seen that his efforts were unsuccessful;
but the journey had not been entirely fruitless,
since it had enabled him to bring back to his friend
some news of the woman she so loved.</p>

<p>At the end of April the good folk of Lille were to
bid farewell to the regiments which had caused them
so much anxiety. While the Colonel-Generals were
leaving the town by the Dunkirk Gate, the townspeople
were watching the long columns of the Normandy
<i>chasseurs</i>, the grenadiers of the Crown, and the Royal-Vaisseaux
disappearing in different directions. What
had been a partial failure in Lille was to break out
again three months later, in another part of the kingdom,
for the affray there was but the prelude to the
revolt of the troops of Chateauvieux, at Nancy, and to
many other risings. The army, in fact, was every day
becoming more and more infected by the spirit of revolution,
which crept in somehow, despite all discipline
and all respect for the commanding officers. And the
army was no untilled field; it was well prepared for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
the seed of the Revolution, which lost no time in taking
root there.</p>

<p>This explains the discouragement which nearly all
the officers felt. They were gentlemen of unflinching
Royalist sympathies, but they perceived the fruitlessness
of their efforts to re-establish discipline and to preserve
their authority. Frotté was especially a prey to this
feeling. We shall see that during his time at Dunkirk
he found it impossible to conquer the hopeless lassitude
that was growing on him. And yet Dunkirk is not
far from Lille, and he knows that he has left behind
him there a friend who will console and guide him.
But his restless, questioning turn of mind makes it
difficult for him to reconcile himself to accomplished
facts. He can feel no sympathy for this Revolution,
which now strides over France as with seven-leagued
boots; he has, indeed, an instinctive repulsion for it.
Frotté is an indefatigable scribbler, and in the long
idle hours of his soldier-life he confides to paper all
his fears and discouragements, while keeping up, at the
same time, a regular correspondence, especially with his
friends Vallière and Lamberville. It is a curious fact,
already commented on by his biographer, M. de la
Sicotière, that this intrepid and active officer, this
flower of partisans, who spent three-fourths of his time
in warfare, was yet the most prolific of writers and
editors.</p>

<p>At Dunkirk he encountered among the officers of
the regiment Viennois, which shared with his own the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
garrison of the place, a very favourable disposition
towards his plans. His Royalist zeal, fostered by his
friendships, was to find an outlet. Already the National
Assembly, eager to secure the army on its side, had
issued a decree obliging the officers to take the oath
not only to the King, but to the nation, and to whatever
Constitution might be given to France. Nothing
would induce our young gentleman to take such an
oath as that. He never hesitated for a moment, and
he succeeded in influencing several of his brother officers
to think as he did. It was thus that he announced his
decision to his father:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You already know, my dear father, that an oath is now exacted
from us officers which disgusts every honourable and decent feeling
that I have. I <i>could</i> not take it. I know you too well, father, not
to be certain that you would have advised me to do just what I have
done. And of course I did not depend only on my own poor judgment;
I consulted most of my brother officers, and amongst those
whom I esteem and love, I have not found <i>one</i> who thinks differently
from myself. Our dear chief, too, M. de Théon, has been just the
good fellow we always thought him.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
</div>

<p>His friend Vallière, on hearing of his conduct and his
intentions, wrote to him in enthusiastic admiration.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am truly delighted to hear” (he wrote some days before his
arrival at Dunkirk) “that the regiment Viennois is almost of the
same way of thinking as our own, so that we are sure to get on well
with them. Then there <i>are</i> still some decent Frenchmen, and some
subjects who are faithful to their one and lawful master! Alas! there
are not many of them, and one can only groan when one thinks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
how many old and hitherto courageous legions ... have stained
irretrievably their ancient glory by this betrayal of their sovereign.
Well, my dear fellow, we must hope that you will have some peace
now to make up for all that you have been going through. Unfortunately,
the immediate future does not seem likely to make us forget
the past, or to promise us much happiness. If the scoundrels who
are persecuting us, and ruining all the best things in Europe, take
it into their heads to disband the Army (as one hears that they
may), be sure to come here for refuge. Everything is still quiet
here.... If their fury still pursues us, we will leave a country
that has become hateful to us, and go to some foreign shore, where
there will perhaps be found some kind folk to pity us and give us a
home in their midst.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The first hint at emigration! Frotté was already
thinking of it; often he had envisaged the idea, but,
before giving up all hope, he wanted to make one last
effort.</p>

<p>The proximity of Lille enabled him to keep up unbroken
relations, during the summer and winter of
1790, with the officers of the garrison he had just left.
A plot had even been roughly sketched out with Lady
Atkyns’ assistance; but a thousand obstacles retarded
from day to day any attempt at carrying it out, and
once more our poor young soldier was totally discouraged.
Despairing of success, disgusted with everything,
he began to meditate escape from an existence
which yielded him nothing but vexations, and, little by
little, he ceased to brood seriously over the thought of
suicide. He spoke of it openly and at length to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
friend Lamberville, in a strange composition which he
called <i>My profession of faith</i>, and which has been almost
miraculously preserved for us.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This confession is dated
February 20, 1791. We should have given it in its
entirety if it were not so long.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> After a quasi-philosophical
preamble—Frotté was addicted to that kind of
thing—he described to his friend the miserable state of
mind that he was in, with all his troubles and his
griefs. In his opinion, a man who had fallen to such
depths of ill-fortune could do but one thing, and that
was, to give back to God the life which he had received
from Him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My ideas about suicide are not” (he added) “the outcome of
reading nor of example; they are the result of much reflection. I
have long since familiarized myself with the idea of death; it no
longer seems to me a sad thing, but rather a certain refuge from
the troubles of life.... When I consider my own situation, and
that of my country; when I think of what I have been, what I am,
and what I may become, I can find no reason for valuing my own
life. Moreover, I live in an age of crime, and it is my native land
that is most subjected to its sway.”</p>
</div>

<p>And Frotté went on to describe his past life to his
friend, telling him of the way he had behaved hitherto,
of the principles that had guided him, the hopes he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
cherished in the brighter opening days of life; then the
disappointments and the discomfitures that had overwhelmed
him. The events he had lived through filled
his mind with bitterness.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was born to be a good son and a good friend, a tender lover, a
good soldier, a loyal subject—in a word, a decent fellow. But it
breaks my heart to see how my compatriots have altered from
kindly human beings to crazy ruffians, and have so accustomed
themselves to slaughter, incendiarism, murder, and robbery, that they
can never again be what they used to be. They have trampled
every virtue under foot; they torture the hearts that still love
them.... And my own profession, soldiering, is dishonoured;
there is no glory about it now; my country is in a state of anarchy
which appals me.”</p>
</div>

<p>Very evident in these pages, written in a delicate
cramped handwriting, is the continual bent towards
self-analysis, towards minute details of feeling, towards
a lofty and remote attitude, so markedly characteristic
of Frotté’s prose.</p>

<p>Many pages of the thick, ribbed paper, fastened together
with a sky-blue ribbon, are filled with the same
kind of reflections; then he suddenly breaks off altogether.
Had he carried out his intention? Was that
why he ceased to write? Not at all; for two months
later, on April 10, there is a further confession, and the
young soldier-philosopher begins by admitting that he
has changed his mind; he defends himself on that
point, and says that reflection has made him resolve to
give up such gloomy views for himself. First of all, the
fear of causing irreparable grief to his father had made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
him pause (and yet their relations do not seem to have
been so affectionate as of yore);<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and then the desire to
settle certain debts, considerable enough, that he would
leave behind him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In fact,” (he says) “since fresh troubles are overwhelming me,
I have decided not to choose this moment for suicide. <i>I want to be
quite calm, on the day that I set out on the Great Journey.</i>... The
month of August saw my birth; it shall see my death.... But I
don’t want to play for effect. I try my best to seem just the same
and to let no one guess what I am thinking of.... Then there’s
another reason for my going on with life. Since I was born a nobleman
of France, I want to do my duty as one.... My sword may
still be of some use to my King and to my friends; and since I must
die, I want my death to benefit my family and my country.... I
shall fasten up this confession, until the moment comes for me to
die. If I have the good luck to fight, and die in the cause of
honour, this, my dear Lamberville, will console you a little, for it
will prove to you that death was a comfort to me. If disorder and
dissolution are still reigning in France when August comes, if there
has been no attempt to restore order—then I shall lose all hope,
and all the reasons that I give you here will acquire full force. I
shall not be able to hesitate. I shall then take up my pen again to
add my last wishes, and my last farewell to my tenderest and dearest
friend.”</p>
</div>

<p>In spite of the melancholy tone of these pages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
their author had finally taken the advice which came
to him from all directions, from people who loved him
and were in his confidence, and who deeply grieved to
hear of such a state of mind. There was none more
loyal than that young Vallière of whom we have
already spoken. At that time he was on leave in
the Caux district. Frotté and he were very intimate,
and Vallière knew every step that was made towards
the carrying out of the plot which had been arranged
simultaneously at Lille and at Dunkirk.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am very sorry,” he wrote to his friend on November 13, 1790,
“that the things you had to tell me could only be entrusted to me
verbally. However, in the absence of further knowledge, there
was nothing for me to do but simply come here,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> where in any case
I had business, and where I am now waiting quietly for the carrying
out of the promises you made me, being, as you know, fully
prepared. But, my dear fellow, I see with amazement that nothing
as yet is happening to verify your forecast. Can you possibly have
been prematurely sanguine, or has the plan miscarried? Perhaps it
is merely a question of delay—Well! That is all right, and I hope
that’s what it is.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Two months later, Vallière, who had doubtless gone
to Paris to make inquiries, gave the following account
of his journey:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I came back on the 3rd instant; and I shall have no difficulty
in telling you of all my doings in Paris, for I did nothing in the
least out-of-the-way. I lived there like a good quiet citizen, who
confines himself to groaning (since he can do nothing better) over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
all the afflicting things he sees. I went from time to time to see
our ‘August Ones,’ and they always put me in a furious temper.”</p>
</div>

<p>Our “August Ones,” as Vallière mockingly called
them, were the members of the Constituent Assembly,
and they were busied with the elaboration of that
gigantic piece of work, the Constitution, which was
to substitute the new order for the old traditions of
France. Little by little the edifice was growing, built
upon the ruins of the past. The sight of it filled with
vexation and fury those who, like Frotté, deplored the
fallen Royalty, the lost privileges, the dispossessed
nobility, of the old order. For the rest, our chevalier,
during his stay at Dunkirk, had frequent news about
his fair friend at Lille. One day it would be a brother
officer who would write, “I played cards yesterday
with your fair lady, who looked as pretty as an angel,
if angels ever <i>are</i> so pretty as were told they are. She
is going to have her portrait painted in oils by my
favourite artist. I dare say she’ll manage somehow to
get a copy done in miniature for her Chevalier!”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Or another time he would be told to come to a
concert at which a place had been taken for him....
In a word, the time went on; and, kicking against the
pricks, our young soldier awaited the moment when he
might bring his plans to realization.</p>

<p>From month to month the spirit of insubordination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
which had crept into the regiment with the events at
Lille was gaining ground, and showing itself more and
more overtly. The Garde Nationale recently formed
at Dunkirk showed signs of it. At the head of this
was an enterprising officer, of the “new order,” named
Emmery, who sought persistently to win the troops
of the garrison over to his own way of thinking. But
he found his match in the colonel of the regiment,
the Chevalier de Théon, a staunch Royalist, who had
no intention of pandering with the enemy. In a small
place like Dunkirk, shut up between its ramparts—the
barracks were in the middle of the town—it was
physically impossible to prevent the soldiers from
coming in contact with the townsfolk. M. de Théon
and his officers (the majority of whom were on his
side) had seen that very clearly; and suddenly, in the
month of June, they resolved to try a bold stroke.
Dunkirk was only five leagues from the Austrian
frontier, which was some hours’ distance from Brussels,
where already the forces of resistance of the anti-revolutionary
party were concentrating. They resolved
on winning Belgium to their cause, on gaining over
the troops, and on offering their services to the Prince’s
Army, which was forming beyond the frontier.</p>

<p>Before executing this scheme, Louis de Frotté is
secretly sent to Brussels. He there sees the Marquis
de la Queville, formerly a member of the Constitutional
Assembly, and deputy of Riom, who has become agent
for the Princes; but little attention is paid to Frotté’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
proposals, and no promises of any kind are made.
Frotté returns somewhat discouraged to Dunkirk.</p>

<p>Suddenly, like a clap of thunder, resounds the news
which is to throw the kingdom into confusion for three
days. During the night of June 20-21 the Royal
Family have escaped from the Tuileries, despite
Lafayette’s guards, and the berlin which holds them
is driving rapidly towards the frontier. Directly the
exploit is known messengers set off in all directions,
despatched by the National Assembly; they take
chiefly the northerly roads, where everything points
to the probable finding of the fugitives. The authorities
at Dunkirk, in their turn, receive despatches from
Paris, and take extra precautions.</p>

<p>This was quite enough to let loose the thunderstorm
that was gathering in the garrison.</p>

<p>On June 23, at 11 a.m., the grenadiers of the
Colonel-General, who had been skilfully worked upon
by some of the agitators, signed the following protestation,
and refused to follow their officers. They
actually succeeded in raising the whole garrison.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When the Commonwealth is in danger” (so one may read in
their manifest), “when the enemies of our blessed revolution raise
an audacious resistance, when a cherished King abandons his people
and flies to his enemies’ side—the duty of all true Frenchmen is
to unite, to join forces! There should be but one cry—Liberty!
Resolute to conquer, we should confront our enemies with a body of
men who are ready to dare all at the lightest sign, and to wash off
with the blood of traitors the insult done to a free people!”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>
<p>Then came the announcement of a federative compact,
to which were summoned the representatives of the
municipality, the National Guards, and the Club of the
Friends of the Constitution.</p>

<p>And here arises a question. Were Frotté and his
friends aware of the King’s intentions? It is difficult
to be sure; but, hasty as their decision apparently was,
it had really been fixed for some time, as is clearly
shown by the following lines written by Frotté to his
father at that very time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was arranged this morning that I am to go to Furnes with
several of my comrades, on Saturday; and there, dear father, I
shall await your wise decision as to whether I shall return home to
you or go to join the Prince de Condé.”</p>
</div>

<p>Furnes is a small village about fifteen kilometres
from Dunkirk. It was then on Austrian territory, and
had been chosen as the rendezvous for the fugitive
officers.</p>

<p>On Friday, June 24, in the afternoon, each of these
“gentlemen” received a secret message from Colonel
de Théon, giving them his instructions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Set out for Furnes” (he told them) “immediately on reading
this; make no preparations; just take whatever money you may
have, and do not worry about your other possessions; they will be
seen to later. I invoke the aid of Heaven upon our enterprise—may
we all meet that same night at Furnes.</p>

<p class="right">
“Your friend for life,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2.5em;">“<span class="smcap">Théon</span>.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>At the same time, he made to his soldiers a last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
supreme appeal, conjuring them to respond to it, and
to come back to the path of duty.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Soldiers, your King was put in irons and the news of his
capture is false. Surely it is impossible that the leading regiment
should fail to join him, to form his bodyguard, and to shield him
from the knives of the assassins who have, of course, been sent after
him. We, who bear the ensign of the General of Infantry, shall
find all good Frenchmen and true patriots ... rallying round our
colours. Believe me, when that happens, the Royalist party, which
is very numerous, will declare itself, and when it sees that it can
do so without endangering its sovereign’s life, will flaunt the white
cockade. Let us, too, wear this as our symbol of France—not the
colours of a regicide and factious prince, the scandal of his country
and the author of all the evils which are now rending it. Your
officers, your real friends, await you at Furnes, where the august
brother of your Queen has given orders (as on all the frontiers) that
the faithful servants of the unhappy Louis XVI. are to be received,
when they arrive there on his service....</p>

<p>“Come there, then—meet there, renew your early oath of fidelity
to the most upright of kings. But as for such as you as are infected
with the maxims of the Club, such of you as think you are patriots,
because you have neither faith, nor law, nor honour—such as these
had better stay in their dens. Only those are adjured to come
whose hearts still tell them they are Frenchmen. Long live the
King!”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But it was too late. The hour for such an appeal
had gone by.</p>

<p>Towards five o’clock on the evening of the same day,
just as the roll-call was ending in the barracks, the
officers of the Colonel-Generals (and several brother-soldiers
from the Viennois regiment) left the town in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
groups of three. They took with them the white <i>cornette</i>
of the infantry, and the flags of their regiments, which
they had torn from the handles. They had not been
able to make up their minds to leave their colours
behind. When they had passed the ramparts some
of them went to the right over the downs which run
along the coast, and which the fugitives intended to
use as their path to the frontier; the others struck into
the open country, and crossed the canal; as soon as
they were out of sight, however, they rejoined the first
lot. At eight o’clock that evening the boatmen on
the Furnes ferry took over two more, and these were
MM. d’Averton and De La Motte.</p>

<p>Now, at that hour, the Royal berlin and its freight
had just left la Ferti-sous-Jouarre, on the high-road to
Châlons, and was proceeding slowly through the dust,
followed and accompanied by a noisy, drunken crowd,
towards Meaux. It was caught at Varennes; and the
fugitives, foiled in their attempt, went back to Paris,
from that day forth to be their prison.</p>

<p>The news of their capture, so unluckily contradicted
by de Théon in his manifesto, might possibly have
altered the plans of the officers from Dunkirk. But
we hardly think so. Their arrangements had long
since been made, and the Varennes episode gave them,
suddenly, an opportunity to carry them out. But
imagine their discomfiture when they heard of the
dramatic ending of the attempt.</p>

<p>It was again Frotté who had been sent to Brussels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
to carry to his King the standard of the regiment.</p>

<p>He arrived there at night, met the Marquis de la
Queville, and learnt the truth from him. Instead of
the King, it was the King’s brother, the Comte de
Provence, whom Frotté found there; for <i>Monsieur</i>,
more fortunate than the others, had reached the frontier
without any trouble.</p>

<p>Thus the affair had partly failed. There was nothing
for the fugitive officers to do but go and join the ever-increasing
tribe of <i>émigrés</i> who lined the frontier. They
withdrew to Ath, in Hainault, the rendezvous of many
exiles.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>What happened at Dunkirk when their absence was
discovered? On the 25th, at 5 a.m., a “good patriot,”
M. François, awoke the commandant of the Garde
Nationale, M. Emmery, and presented to him the
manifesto of the “Sieur de Théon.” The alarm spread
instantly through the town; it was with indignation
that people heard the news of the desertion of the
officers, who had even been so infamous as to carry
off the regimental colours. The soldiers chose new
officers, and held a meeting on the parade-ground. M.
Emmery came to them, and tried to pacify them by
offering them one of the colours of the Garde Nationale,
to replace those which had been filched from them. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
was enthusiastically received. Hopes rose high once
more. Grenadiers and <i>gardes nationaux</i> met in warmest
comradeship; and the tricolour was sent for, and presented
to the regiment, which was drawn up in battle-array.
Vengeance was vowed against traitors and
enemies of the Republic. “From that moment there
reigned boundless confidence, perfect joy, and assured
tranquillity.”</p>

<p>But this was not all. It had to be ascertained whether
the runaways had left anything behind them. The
Justice of the Peace for the Quartier-du-Midi, Pierre
Taverne, betook himself to the officers’ quarters in the
barracks. On the first storey, under the landing, there
was a door which led into the room that was known to
have been Frotté’s. That door was sealed, as were those
of all his brother-officers’ rooms. Five days later the
seals were broken. The inspection brought nothing
noteworthy to light. In Frotté’s room they found
two helmets, a cross-belt, and a gorget. The others
were still less exciting; a cap and two portmanteaus,
“containing a little music,” were found in M. Derampan’s
quarters; a cap and a double-barrelled gun in
M. Metayer’s; a trunk in M. de Dreuille’s; a cap and
a cross-belt in M. Demingin’s, and so on. The Royal
tent contained a cabriolet belonging to M. de Théon;
the stables, “near the fuel-stores,” yielded another old
cabriolet, the property of M. de Frotté. Everything
was confiscated, and taken to the Municipality.</p>

<p>The only thing which interested the authorities was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
a trunk full of papers, which had been seized in Frotté’s
quarters. It was examined, but no proofs were found of
the suspected conspiracy. It was then tied up, sealed,
and sent to the Research Committee of the National
Assembly, with a curt account of the occurrence. On
the evening of June 28 this was read to the Deputies
of the Assembly, some of whom were very angry on
hearing the defiant appeal of de Théon to his soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Was Lady Atkyns at Lille to hear the issue of the
adventure? She had more probably left France by
that time, terrified by all that was going on around her,
and the more so that she was alone, for her friends on
every side had left her.</p>

<p>While her lover was languishing among the <i>émigrés</i>
(made miserable by their inaction and selfishness) she
regained her old home at Ketteringham, uneasy in her
mind, but not despairing. She saw plainly what her
own path was to be; for her love for the Queen and
the Queen’s people was henceforth to rule her life, and
carry her on from one devoted action to another.</p>

</div>

<p>While the Court and the Army of the <i>émigrés</i>
were being organized at Coblentz and Worms, under
the direction of Monsieur, Comte de Provence, of the
Comte d’Artois, and of the Prince de Condé, and while
rivalry and jealousies and a thousand other causes of
dissension were already cropping up in that environment
(so often and always so unfavourably depicted),
other troops of similar fugitives were leaving the
eastern coast and, embarking from the Channel port, or
stopping first on the islands of Jersey and Guernsey,
were gradually arriving on English soil, there to find
an assured refuge. In the last months of 1791, and in
the beginning of 1792, they came thither in thousands.
Bretons, Normans, nobles, ecclesiastics, journalists, young
officers, fleeing persecution, pillage, arbitrary arrests,
came hastening to enjoy the hospitality of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>London was soon full of refugees; but the majority
of these unfortunate folk, despite their illustrious names,
were in a state almost of destitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>The more prosperous ones, those who had been able to
rescue something from the shipwreck, succeeded in finding
homes in the suburbs—modest boarding-houses, or
little cottages—where they installed their families. But
these were the exceptions; and in every street French
gentlefolk were to be met with who had no property
but what they carried on their backs. Many of them
knew no English; and still overwhelmed by the dangers
they had passed through, and thus suddenly plunged
into strange surroundings, without resources, without
even a handicraft, went wandering despairingly about
the city, in search of bread.</p>

<p>They were not allowed to starve. Most admirably
did English charity accept this influx of new
inhabitants.</p>

<p>The last years of the reign of Louis XVI., together
with the War of Independence in the United States, had
markedly chilled the relations between France and her
neighbours across the Channel. Revolutionary ideas
from the frontiers had at first met with some sympathy
amongst this favoured people, who had been in the
enjoyment of true liberty for a century. But when
English folk came to know of the excess which these
ideas had resulted in, of the anarchy which had been let
loose in all directions, of the violence which was the
order of the day—their distrust, indignation, and horror
effaced that earlier sympathy.</p>

<p>King George III., supported by his Minister, Pitt,
felt from that time an aversion which grew to implacable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
hatred for anything even remotely connected with the
French Revolution.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, he (and, indeed, almost the whole
of the aristocracy) welcomed the refugees, and encouraged
their sojourn in the kingdom—glad, no
doubt, of the opportunity for displaying his opinion
of the new ideas, by helping on the exodus of a part
of the inhabitants of France, an exodus which would
contribute to the weakening of that country.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason may have been, there is abundant
evidence of the inexhaustible charity that the new-comers
met with in English society. Benevolent committees
were formed, presided over by dukes and
duchesses, marquises and marchionesses.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> When the
first necessities of the poor creatures had been provided
for by the establishment of cheap restaurants, hotels,
and bazaars, their friends sought out occupations for
them, so that they might be in a position to earn their
own livelihood. The clergy were the first to profit
by this solicitude. The decree of August 26, 1792,
ordaining the deportation of non-juring priests, had
driven them in a body from the continent. It was
well for those who were thus driven out, for of their
comrades who remained the most part were in the
end persecuted and entrapped. The greater number
chose England for their place of refuge. They came
thither in crowds—so much so that, at the Terror,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
there were as many as 8000.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Many were Bretons.
One of them, Carron, came to London preceded by
a reputation for holiness. He had founded at Rennes
a cotton-cloth factory which gave employment to more
than 2000 poor people. The famous Decree of August
26 affected him, and thus forced him to abandon his
enterprise. He went to Jersey, and recommenced his
work there; but left the island at the end of some
time, and came to settle in England. There he set
up an alms-house for his destitute coreligionists, and
acted the part of a sort of Providence to them. Nor
was he the only one they had.</p>

<p>Jean-François de la Marche, Bishop of Saint-Pol-de-Léon,
had, ever since the early months of 1791, incurred
the wrath and fury of the Attorney-General of the
department of Finisterre. This prelate, who was profoundly
loved in his diocese, refused to give up his
bishopric, which had recently been suppressed by the
National Assembly. He was accused of fomenting
agitation in the department, and of inciting the curés
to resistance. He was violently denounced at the
National Assembly, and treated as a disturber of the
public peace. Summoned to Paris to exculpate himself,
together with his colleagues, the Bishops of Tréguier
and Morbihan, he took no notice of the order, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
escape arrest, which threatened him, and for which he
was being pursued by the Cavalry Police, he had but
one resource—to get right away from Brittany. He
came to London in the first batch of <i>émigrés</i>. From
the outset he had but one idea: to look after his
companions in misfortune, to help them in their need,
to find employment for them. To this end he served
as intermediary between the Government and the
priests, pleading the cause of these latter, and keeping
registers of the names and qualifications of all with
whom he became concerned.</p>

<p>In spite of so many reasons for melancholy, one
thing that struck the English people was the extraordinary
gaiety of nature displayed by most of the
<i>émigrés</i> so soon as they found themselves in security.
These good folk, many of whom landed half-starved,
exhausted and ragged, were somehow not entirely
disheartened, and, indeed, on commencing life afresh,
displayed an extraordinary spirit and cheerfulness.
Very quickly, even in the alien country, they formed
into circles of friends who saw each other every day,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
eager to exchange impressions, reminiscences, and
hopes, to get news from the Homeland and from those
members of their families who had not been able to
leave it; they felt keenly the need of a common
existence, in which they could cheer and encourage
one another. And what a kindly grace they showed,
what a brave spirit, amid all the little disagreeables of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
a way of life so different from that of the good old
days! At the dinners which they gave one another,
each would bring his own dish. “’Twas made,” says
the Count d’Haussonville, “into a little attention to
the visitors of the house for a man to take a taper
from his pocket, and put it, lighted, on the chimney-piece!”
In the daytime the men-folk gave lessons
or worked as secretaries (or bookbinders, like the
Count de Caumont, for instance). The women did
needlework, which the English ladies, their patronesses,
busied themselves in selling at bazaars.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>But side by side with the gentlemen who took their
exile so patiently and philosophically, there was a
whole group of <i>émigrés</i> who longed to play a less
passive part. These were the men and women who
had fled from France and brought their illusions with
them—those inconceivable illusions which mistook so
entirely the true character, importance, and extent of
the Revolution, and could still, therefore, cherish the
hope of some kind of revenge. Totally misunderstanding
the feelings of the English Government,
unable to comprehend the line taken by Pitt and his
Cabinet, and blinded by their stubborn hatred, these
men and women actually imagined that, to their
importunate appeals, Great Britain could respond by
furnishing them with arms, soldiers, and money to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
equip a fleet, form an army, and go back to France
as the avengers of the “hideous Revolution.” They
assailed the Minister with offers, counsels, and schemes—for
the most part quite impracticable; were refused,
but still cherished their delusion. Some of them were
honest, but many were of that class of adventurer with
which the Emigration was swarming, and which was the
thorn in the side of all the anti-revolutionary agencies.
The well-warned Government could give them but one
reception. Pitt had not the least idea of listening to
the proposals of these gentry and personally intervening
in favour of the Royalists of France.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>England at that time was deeply concerned with
Indian affairs; and, in spite of the lively sympathy inspired
by the grievous situation of the Royal Family at
the Tuileries, she could not dream of departing, at any
rate just then, from an attitude of benevolent neutrality.</p>

<p>In her manor-house of Ketteringham, where she
spent the winter of 1791-92, Lady Atkyns was not
forgetful of her French friends. The <i>Gazette</i> brought
her week by week news of the events in Paris, of the
troubles in the provinces, of the deliberations of the
National Assembly. But what she looked for first of
all was intelligence about the inhabitants of the Tuileries,
whose agitated and anguished lives she anxiously
followed. Separation redoubled her sympathetic adoration
of the lady whom she had seen and worshipped at
Versailles. Thus we can imagine what her grief must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
have been on hearing the details of that 20th of June—the
invaded palace, the interminable line of the people
defiling before the King, the attitude of Marie-Antoinette,
protecting her son against the ferocious curiosity
of the petitioners, and surrounded only by a few faithful
allies who made a rampart for her with their bodies.
Lady Atkyns’ heart had failed her as she read of all
this. The day of the Tenth of August, the massacre of
the Swiss Guards, the flight of the King and Queen,
their transfer to the Temple Prison, and incarceration
there—these things redoubled her anguish. She went
frequently to London for information, and returned,
sad and anxious, to her dear Norfolk home, made
miserable by her impotence to do anything that might
save the Queen.</p>

<p>With her great love for the Royalist cause, she
naturally associated herself warmly with the benevolent
efforts of English society to help the <i>émigrés</i>. She
knew many of the names, and when she heard talk of
D’Harcourts, Beauvaus, Veracs, Fitz-Jameses, Mortemarts,
all the life at Versailles must have come back
to her—the Queen’s “set,” the receptions, the festivities.</p>

<p>It was during one of her visits to London that she
made the acquaintance of a man whom she had long
wished to know, and whose articles she always eagerly
read—I allude to Jean-Gabriel Peltier, the editor of the
<i>Acts of the Apostles</i>, that extravagantly Royalist sheet
which had such an immense vogue in a certain circle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
since the days of ’89. Peltier was born near Angers;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
his real name was Dudoyer—of a business family. After
an adventurous youth, and a sojourn at Saint-Domingo
(where, it seems, he did not lead a blameless life), he
came to Paris at the beginning of the Revolution.
According to a police report of doubtful authenticity, he
flung himself heart and soul into the revolutionary
cause, speechifying side by side with Camille Desmoulins
at the Palais-Royal, flaunting one of the first
rebel flags, and marching to the Taking of the Bastille.
Then, all of a sudden, he turns his coat, becomes a
blazing Royalist, and founds a newspaper with the
curious title of <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>. For the space
of two years he then attacks violently, recklessly, everything
and everybody so mistaken as not to agree with
his own ideas. The style of the paper is sarcastic, and
frequently licentious. The author has been found fault
with for his insults and his invectives; his sheet has
been styled “infamous;” but when we remember the
prevailing tone of the Press at that time, and the condition
of the public mind, is it not only fair to grant
some indulgence to the quartette—Peltier, Rivarol,
Champcnetz, and Sulau—who took in hand so
ardently and enthusiastically the interests of the
King?</p>

<p>On August 10, when he had dismissed the other
editors of the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>, and stopped the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
publication of the paper, Peltier, feeling no longer safe
in Paris, took the step of emigrating. He came to
London with the idea of founding a new periodical,
which was to be called <i>The Political Correspondence of
the True Friends of the King</i>.</p>

<p>Tall and thin, with powdered hair, and a lofty bald
forehead, always inveighing fervently against something
or other (so Chateaubriand depicts him), Peltier
answered in some degree to the traditional type of
journalist in those days, when “journalist” meant at
once gazetteer, lampoonist, and pamphleteer. Judging
by his writings alone, one can understand the small
confidence that his English acquaintances placed in
him; but under his somewhat eccentric mode of expression
Peltier concealed a very real and deep devotion to
the King’s cause.</p>

<p>His acquaintance with Lady Atkyns dates from
November, 1792. This lady spent a great part of her
long leisurely days in the country in reading. She
was told of the recent publications by Peltier; she had
known only of some of these, and instantly off she writes
to the journalist, asking him for the first numbers of
the book which he is bringing out. Needless to say,
her desire is at once gratified.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> She devours the writings
of the author of <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>; she
joins in his anger, shares his admirations, and a regular
correspondence begins between these two persons, drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
together as they were by a common sympathy for the
Royal Family of France.</p>

<p>When they have exchanged reminiscences of past days,
they come to consider the present. Lady Atkyns has been
fretting for weeks over her inaction. A thousand thoughts
disturb her, all converging towards the same idea:
can she do anything to save the King and the Queen?
Does she not possess a considerable fortune, and who is
to prevent her from arranging to devote a part of it to
the realization of her dream? And in truth this woman,
who was a foreigner, who was bound by no real tie of
any kind to the inmates of the Tuileries, <i>was</i> actually to
attempt, through the strength alone of her love and her
heroic devotion, what no one had yet succeeded in. A
superhuman energy sustained her; one thought only
was henceforth to rule her life, and not once did she
falter, nor doubt, nor lose the ardour of her feeling.</p>

<p>To whom better could she address herself than to
him who seemed to understand her so well? Peltier
was told of her intentions. Their letters grew more
frequent, their project begins to take shape.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In truth, madame” (Peltier writes), “the more I read you, the
more your zeal astonishes and moves me. You are more intrepid
and more ardent than any Frenchman, even among those who are
most attached to their King. But have you reflected upon the
dozen doors, the dozen wickets and tickets that must be arranged
for, before you can get into Court? I know that to tell you of
difficulties is but to inflame your desire to overcome them; moreover,
I do not doubt that your new scheme has taken all these
difficulties into account.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>When this plan had been modified and approved by
Peltier, it stood thus: First of all, to find two safe
correspondents in Paris, to whom letters and a statement
of the scheme could be sent. And these two men
were there, ready to hand—both whole-heartedly Royalists,
both tried men. They were MM. Goguelat and
Gougenot. The first, who was M. de Bouillé’s aide-de-camp,
had taken an active part in the Varennes affair,
but he had not shown the greatest discretion, for all he
had succeeded in doing was to get wounded. The
second, who was the King’s steward, had been in the
secret of the flight. The plotters also meant to get
into relations with the two physicians of Louis XVI.,
MM. Lemonnier and Vicq d’Azyr, who would give
most valuable aid in the passing of notes into the
Temple Prison, for and to the prisoners. But the great
difficulty would be the King. How was <i>he</i> to be
brought to their way of thinking? Would he consent
to listen to the proposals they were to transmit to him?
“That” (declares Peltier) “is what no one can be sure
of, considering the state of prostration that he must be
in after such terrible and incessant misfortunes.”</p>

<p>Nor was this all. They had to find an intelligent
and nimble agent, who could cross from England to
France once, twice, many times if necessary; who could
have interviews with the persons indicated, and, above
all, who could manage to procure detailed plans of the
Temple Prison. An ordinary courier would not do.
Well, it just happened that Peltier <i>had</i> relations with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
a foreign nobleman, Hungarian by birth, whom he had
come to know by chance, and who even helped him
with his publications. He had, in fact, made this
gentleman his collaborator. His name was d’Auerweck,
and as he happened to be in France at that very
moment, he could easily betake himself to Paris, and,
in Peltier’s opinion, would fill most admirably the
delicate post with which he was to be entrusted.</p>

<p>Finally, throughout the plot, they were to make use
in correspondence of a “sympathetic” ink, “which
could only be read when held near the fire.”</p>

<p>Here is the cost of the first preparations:—</p>

<table class="autotable">
<tr><th></th><th class="tdr page">£</th><th class="tdr page"><i>s.</i></th><th class="tdr page"><i>d.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="wide">Journey to Paris by diligence             </td><td class="tdr page">5  </td><td class="tdr page">5  </td><td class="tdr page">0</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td class="tdr bt page">26  </td><td class="tdr bt page">5  </td><td class="tdr bt page">0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>That is a sum of about 650 francs. Needless to say,
the journalist <i>émigré</i>, like most of his compatriots,
was entirely unable to give the smallest contribution to
the expenses of the enterprise; but Lady Atkyns was
there, ready for any sacrifice; they were to apply to
her for everything necessary.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Peltier pointed out again the difficulties
of a general escape.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Above all, madame, do not forget that I foresee a great difficulty
in bringing out the three principal members of the family. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
may possibly think themselves safer in the Temple than on the
high-road. The personal risk which you are running makes me
shudder. Your courage is worthy of the admiration of all Europe,
and if any harm comes to you, as the result of so heroic an enterprise,
I shall be among those who will deplore it most.”</p>
</div>

<p>Three days later another letter came to Ketteringham,
telling of the good progress of the attempt.
Peltier was going to despatch his servant to Amiens,
whither the Baron d’Auerweck had gone, and the latter
would in this way receive his instructions.</p>

<p>But there was no time to lose. The storm was
muttering in Paris. Pressed by the “Forward” groups,
frightened by the redoubled insurrections, the Convention
had been compelled to proceed to the trial of
the King. “Circumstances are becoming so urgent,”
wrote Peltier, “that we have not a moment to lose;
they talk of trying the King so as to calm down the
insurrections that are breaking out everywhere.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, it was necessary to make haste. After
the discovery of the papers in the famous “Iron Press”
in the Tuileries, the Convention had agreed that the
King should appear before them. On December 10
Robert Lindet made his report, and the next day
Barbaroux presented “the deed enunciating the crimes
of Louis Capet.” On the same day the King appeared
before the bar of the Convention, there to answer the
thirty-one questions which were put to him.</p>

<p>Like lightning, this terrifying news crossed the
Channel, and reached London in a few hours. Peltier’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
rooms filled with horrified people, “who met there all
day long to weep and despair.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I cannot conceal from you, madame,” wrote Peltier that evening
to his friend, “that the danger to the Royal Family is very great
at this moment. Truly I cannot hope that they will still be alive
at the end of the fortnight. It is heartrending. You will have
seen the English papers. You will have read Robespierre’s abominable
speech, and how it was applauded by the Tribunes; and, above
all, you will have seen about these new documents, which have been
twisted into a crime of the unhappy King’s because people <i>will not</i>
see that all the steps he took to regain his authority were taken for
the good of his people, and that his sole object was to save them by
force if necessary from the evils which are destroying them, now
that they no longer have a King.”</p>
</div>

<p>But even yet all was not lost. If they arrived too
late to save the King, there was still the Dauphin, “to
whom every one should look.” In a few days the Baron
d’Auerweck would be in Paris, and they would know
exactly how much they might still hope for.</p>

<p>“A Transylvanian nobleman,” was the description
Peltier had given when writing about this new collaborator.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
The epithet, although most attractive—suggestive
as it was of that land of great forests all
wildness and mystery—was not perfectly exact. The
family of Auerweck, though perhaps of Hungarian
origin, had established itself at Vienna, where the father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
of our Baron died as a captain in the Austrian service.
His wife—whose maiden-name had been Scheltheim—had
borne him four children, two boys and two girls.
The two latter were married and settled in Austria.
The elder son, who was born at Vienna about 1766,
was named Louis (Aloys) Gonzago; he added to his
family name that of an estate, Steilenfels, and the title
of Baron—so that the whole thing, when given out
with the proper magniloquence, was quite effective.</p>

<p>“By the particular favour of Marie-Thérèse,” Louis
d’Auerweck entered very young the Military Academy
of Neustadt, near Vienna. On leaving it, he spent four
years in a Hungarian regiment, the “Renfosary;” but
garrison-life bored him, and, independent and ambitious,
he longed to shake off the yoke of militarism which
hampered him in his schemes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have only his own record of his
younger days,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and it is matter for regret that no
more trustworthy information is to be had. For very
curious and interesting is the life of this adventurer,
who was undeniably intelligent and clever, but who was
also an intriguer and a braggart; who knew French
well, and therefore posed as a finished diplomatist, with
pretentions to philosophy and literature; who, in a
word, was filled with a sense of his own importance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and fatally addicted to “playing to the gallery.” Some
quotations from his writings will give a better idea of
him than any description.</p>

<p>Hardly has he left Austria—his reason for doing so
we shall learn from himself—than he sets off on a sort
of educational tour, beginning at Constantinople and
going on to the Mediterranean. He visits, one after
the other, Greece, Malta, Sicily, Spain, the South
of France; he even goes so far as Chambéry and
Lyons. An opportunity turns up, and off he sets
for Paris.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The innovations made by Joseph II., such as the introduction
of the Register and military conscription, caused him to be employed
as an engineer, and as a member of the administrative body formed
to carry out these different schemes. His independent character
instantly displayed itself in a sphere where it was no longer repressed
by that duty of blind obedience which is the very being of
the Army. He could now venture to have an opinion and to
express it, he could criticise the root-idea on the form of an enterprise
by displaying its difficulties or foretelling its non-success (forecasts,
moreover, which time has proved to be sound); he could
speak of the violation of national justice, of a legitimate resistance
to arbitrary power. His experiences under fire, his activity, and
his oratorical talent gave him a position among the malcontents
which he had not sought in any way. In consequence, he ventured
on something more than mere speaking and writing. His travels,
his qualities, his independent and decided character have won for
him friendships and acquaintanceships which have given him the
advantage of never finding himself out of place in any important
centre of affairs. To this he owes that knowledge of the hereditary
prejudices and the sudden caprices of Cabinets, which when joined
to an equal knowledge of the character of their chiefs, ministers,
constitutes <i>diplomacy</i>. To assiduous study he attributes that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
understanding of the true interests of Governments, and of their
respective powers, which constitutes <i>international politics</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such was the personage to whom Lady Atkyns and
Peltier entrusted their enterprise. If they looked after
him carefully, granted him only a limited discretion,
and took the fullest advantage of his intelligence and
his talents, they would probably make something of
the Hungarian nobleman. This was not the Baron’s
first visit to Paris; he knew the capital well. He had
come there at the beginning of the Revolution, in 1789,
and, if we are to believe his own account, “he saw the
results of all these horrors, but was merely laughed at.
If all mankind could have been armed against the
Revolution, he would have armed them!” Moreover,
he had kept up many connections in Paris. By his
own account, the Austrian Minister, Thugut, whom he
had formerly met at Naples, had taken him into his
confidence. In short, his friends in London could not
have made a better choice, as he wrote from Amiens to
Peltier on the receipt of his proposal.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I start for Paris at full speed at five o’clock to-morrow morning.
I need not tell you that from this moment I shall devote myself to
the business of which you have spoken to me, nor need I add that
this devotion is entirely disinterested. If I had not already proved
those two things to you, I should not be the man you require.
But, just because I feel that I <i>have</i> the head and the heart necessary
for your enterprise, I tell you frankly that it can only be carried
out at great expense. The business of getting information—which
is only a preparatory measure—is made difficult, if not impossible,
unless a considerable sum of money can be spent.... I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
myself authorized to speak to you in this way, because I have the
advantage—rare enough amongst men—of being above suspicion
with regard to my own interests.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On Wednesday, December 19, d’Auerweck entered
Paris, and put up at a hotel in the Rue Coq-Héron,
where he gave his name as Scheltheim. He instantly
set to work to get the letters he had brought with him
delivered at their addresses, and to make certain of the
co-operation which was essential to him. But there
was a disappointment in store; Goguelat, upon whom
so much depended, was away from Paris, and, as it
happened, in London. It was necessary to act without
him, and this was no easy matter. The excitement
caused by the trial of the King enforced upon the
plotters a redoubled caution. D’Auerweck got uneasy
when he found no letters coming from Peltier in answer
to his own. He went more frequently to Versailles,
and to Saint-Germain, and kept on begging for funds.
On December 25, the day before M. de Sèze was to
present the King’s defence to the Convention, d’Auerweck
wrote to Peltier—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The persons (you know whom I mean) do not care to arrive
here before Thursday, which is very natural, for there is all sorts of
talk as to what may happen to-morrow.... You promised me to
write by each post; but there can be no doubt that you forgot me
on Tuesday, the 18th, for otherwise I must have had your letters
by this time. One thing I cannot tell you too often: it is that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
consider it essential to take to you in person any documents that I
may be able to procure.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The documents in question were those which Peltier
had alluded to, some days before, in a letter to Lady
Atkyns: “I heard to-day that there was some one in
Paris who had all the plans that you want in the
greatest detail;”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and at the end of the month he
returned to the subject—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am expecting, too, a most exact plan of the Temple Prison,
taken in November; and not only of the Temple, but also of the
caves that lie under the tower—caves that are not generally known
of, and which were used from time immemorial for the burial of the
ancient Templars. I know a place where the wall is only eighteen
inches thick, and debouches on the next street.”</p>
</div>

<p>It becomes evident that Peltier and Lady Atkyns,
almost abandoning any hope of saving the King, whose
situation appeared to them to be desperate, now brought
all their efforts to bear upon the other prisoners of the
Temple.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If His Majesty persists in his reluctance to be rescued from
prison, at least we may still save his poor son from the assassins’
knives. A well-informed man told me, the day before yesterday,
when we were talking of this deplorable business, that people were
to be found in Paris ready, for a little money, to carry off the
Dauphin. They would bring him out of the Temple in a basket, or
else disguised in some way.... I believe that to save the son is to
save the father also. For, after all, this poor child cannot be made
the pretext for any sort of trial, and as the Crown belongs to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
by law on his father’s death, I believe that they would keep the
latter alive, if it were only to checkmate those who would rally
round the Dauphin. But, in the interval, things may have time to
alter, and circumstances may at last bring about a happy change
in this disastrous state of things.”</p>
</div>

<p>The month of December went by in this painful state
of suspense. What anxiety must have fretted the heart
of the poor lady, as she daily followed in the <i>Gazette</i>
the course of the Royal Trial! On New Year’s Day
she had some further words of encouragement from
her friend in London. All was not lost; Louis XVI.
could still reckon, even in the heart of Paris, upon
many brave fellows who would not desert him; and
besides, what about the fatal consequences that would
follow on the crime of regicide? The Members of Convention
would never dare—never....</p>

<p>Fifteen days later comes another missive; and this
time but little hope is left. The “Little Baron”—this
was what they called d’Auerweck—was not being idle.
Peltier had made an opportunity for him of seeing De
Sèze, the King’s counsel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This latter ought to know for certain whether the King does or
does not intend to await his sentence or to expose himself to the
hazards of another flight; but there seems to be very little chance
of his consenting to it. Whatever happens” (added Peltier), “your
desires and your efforts, madam, will not be wasted, either for yourself
or for history. I possess, in your correspondence, a monument
of courage and devotion which will endure longer than London
Bridge.... A trusty messenger who starts to-morrow for Paris
affords me a means of opening my mind to De Sèze for the third
time.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>But it was too late. On January 15 the nominal
appeal upon the thirty-three questions presented to the
Members of Convention had been commenced; two days
later the capital sentence was voted by a majority of
fifty-three.</p>

<p>On January 21, at the hour when the guillotine had
just done its work, the following laconic note reached
Ketteringham to say that all was over:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My honoured friend, all we can do now is to weep. The crime
is consummated. Judgment of death was pronounced on Thursday
evening. D’Orleans voted for it, and he is to be made Protector.
We have nothing now to look forward to but revenge; and our
revenge shall be terrible.”</p>
</div>

<p>Think of the look that must have fallen upon that
date, “January 21!” The postmark of the letter still
shows it quite clearly, on the yellowed sheet.</p>

<p>Could they possibly have succeeded if the King <i>had</i>
listened favourably to their proposal? It is difficult to
say. But it is certainly a fact, that during the last six
months of 1792 there had been on the water, near
Dieppe, a cruising vessel which kept up a constant communication
with the English coast. The truth was that,
finding the Rouen route too frequented, Peltier had
judged the Dieppe one to be infinitely preferable. It
was that way that the fish merchants came to Paris. If
they had succeeded in getting the King outside the
Temple gates it is probable that his escape would have
been consummated. But the prison was heavily guarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
at that time, and during the trial these precautions
were redoubled.</p>

<p>At any rate, there is no doubt that Louis knew of the
attempts to save him from death. Some time after the
event of January 21, Clery, speaking of the King to
the Municipal, Goret, remarked—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Alas! my dear good master could have been saved if he had
chosen. The windows in that place are only fifteen or sixteen feet
above the ground. Everything had been arranged for a rescue,
while he was still there, but he refused, because they could not save
his family with him.”</p>
</div>

<p>There can be no doubt that these words refer to the
attempt of Lady Atkyns and Peltier.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The assent of
the King had alone been wanting to its execution.</p>

<p>It is well known what a terrible and overwhelming
effect was produced in the European Courts by the
news of the King’s execution. In London it was
received with consternation. Not merely the <i>émigrés</i>
(who had added to their numbers there since the
beginning of the Revolution) were thunderstruck by
the blow, but the Court of King George was stupefied
at the audacity of the National Assembly. The Court
went instantly into mourning, and the King ordered the
French Ambassador, Chauvelin, to leave London on the
spot. Some days later war was officially declared
against France.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>The King’s death caused the beginning of that
struggle which was to last so many years and be so
implacably, ferociously waged on both sides.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Any one but Lady Atkyns would have lost heart,
but that heroic woman did not allow herself to be cast
down for an instant. Amid the general mourning, she
still cherished her hopes; moreover, those who had been
helping her had not abandoned her. The “Little Baron”
was still in Paris, awaiting orders, but the gravity of
the situation had obliged him to leave the Hotel Coq-Héron,
where his life was no longer in safety. Well,
they had failed with the King; now they must tempt
fortune, and save the Queen and her children. The
lady at Ketteringham was quite sure of that.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Nothing is yet decided about the Queen’s fate” (Peltier had
written to her at the end of January), “but it has been proposed at
the Commune of Paris to transfer her either to the prison of La
Force or of La Conciergerie.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then Lady Atkyns had an idea. Why should she
not go in person to Paris and try her chance? Probably
the surveillance which had been so rigorously kept
over the King would be far less severe for the Queen.
And one might profit by the relative tranquillity, and
manage to get into the Temple, and then—who could
tell what one might not devise in the way of carrying
the Queen off, or of substituting some one else for her?
She never thought of all the dangers around her, and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
the enormously increased difficulties in the path for a
foreign lady who knew only a little French. Peltier,
to whom she confided her plan, tried to dissuade her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You will hardly have arrived before innumerable embarrassments
will crop up; if you leave your hotel three times in the day,
or if you see the same person thrice, you will become a suspect.”</p>
</div>

<p>But his friend’s persistence ended by half convincing
him, and he admitted that the moment was relatively
favourable, and that it was well to take advantage of it,
if she wished to attempt anything.</p>

<p>Unluckily, things were moving terribly fast in Paris.
There came the days of May 31 and June 2, the efforts
of the sections against the Commune, civil war let loose.
In the midst of this storm, Lady Atkyns feared that the
whole affair might come to nought; her arrangements,
moreover, were not completed. Money, which can do so
much, decide so much, and which had already proved so
powerful—money, perhaps, was not sufficiently forthcoming.
Suddenly there is a rumour that a conspiracy
to favour the Queen’s escape has been discovered.
Two members of the Commune, Lepitre and Toulan,
who had been won over to the cause by a Royalist, the
Chevalier de Jarjays, had almost succeeded in carrying
out their scheme, when the irresolution of one of them
had ruined everything; nevertheless, they were denounced.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Public attention, which had been averted for
a moment, now was fixed again upon the Temple Prison.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>
<p>And the days go by, and Lady Atkyns sees no
chance of starting on her enterprise.</p>

<p>We come here to an episode in her life which seems
to be enveloped in mystery. One fact is proved,
namely, that Lady Atkyns succeeded in reaching Marie
Antoinette, disguised, and at the price of a large sum of
money. But when did this take place? Was the
Queen still at the Temple, or was it after she had been
taken to the Conciergerie? The most reliable witnesses
we have—and they are two of Lady Atkyns’ confidants—seem
to contradict one another.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> A careful weighing
of testimony and an attentive study of the letters which
Lady Atkyns received at this time lead us to conclude,
with much probability, that the attempt was made <i>after</i>
the Queen had been transferred to the Conciergerie;
that is to say, after August 2, 1793.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>Some days before this Peltier had again brought her
to give up her resolve, assuring her that she was vainly
exposing herself to risk—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If you wish to be useful to that family, you can only be so
by directing operations from here (instead of going there to get
guillotined), and by making those sacrifices which you have already
resolved to make.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was of no use. The brave lady listened only to
her heart’s promptings, and set out for Paris. If we
are to believe her friend, the Countess MacNamara<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>—and
her testimony is valuable—she succeeded in winning
over a municipal official, who consented to open
the doors of the Conciergerie for her, on the condition
that no word should be exchanged between her and the
Royal prisoner. Moreover, the foreign lady must wear
the uniform of a National Guard. It was Drury Lane
over again! She promised everything, and was to content
herself with offering a bouquet to the Queen; but
under the stress of the intense emotion she experienced
on meeting once more the eyes of the lady whom she
had not seen since the days at Versailles, she let fall a
note which she held, and which was to have been put
into the Queen’s hand with the bouquet. The Municipal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
officer was about to take possession of it, but, more
prompt than he, Lady Atkyns rushed forward, picked
it up, and swallowed it. She was turned out brutally.
Such was the result of the interview. But the English
lady did not stop there. By more and more promises
and proceedings, by literally strewing her path with
gold, she bought over fresh allies, and this time she
obtained the privilege of spending an hour alone with
the Queen—at what a price may be imagined! It is
said that she had to pay a thousand louis for that single
hour. Her plan was this: to change clothes with the
Queen, who would then leave the Conciergerie instead
of her. But she met with an obstinate refusal. Marie-Antoinette
would not, under any pretext, sacrifice the
life of another, and to abandon her imprisoned children
was equally impossible to her. But what emotion she
must have felt at the sight of such a love, so simple,
so whole-hearted, and so pure! She could but thank
her friend with tearful eyes and commend her son, the
Dauphin, to that friends tender solicitude. She also
gave her some letters for her friends in England.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>On leaving the Conciergerie, one thought filled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
mind of Lady Atkyns: she would do for the son what
she had not been able to do for the mother—she would
drag the little Dauphin out of the Temple Prison.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Did she return to England immediately afterwards?
Probably. For one thing, she had not lost all hope,
and, like the rest of her friends, she did not as yet fear
instant danger for the Queen’s life. This is proved by
a note from Peltier, written in the course of the month
of September, which reveals the existence of a fresh plan.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They must set out on Thursday morning at latest; if they
delayed any longer, the approach of the Austrian troops, and the
movements which have taken place at Paris, might, we fear, determine
the members of the Convention to fly and take with them the
two hostages whom we want to save. One day’s, two days’ delay
may make all the difference. If they are to start on Thursday
morning, and go to Brighton and charter a neutral vessel, they have
only Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to spend, day and night, in
getting everything ready. First of all, we must get some louis
d’or, and sew them in their belts. Then we must get some paper-money,
if it’s only for the journey along the coast to Paris, so that
they may not be suspected.... We must have time to prepare
passports that will do for the three persons who are to go. These
passports must be made to look like the letters that Mr. Dundas is
sending for the Jacobins who are being deported from France.
They are thus less likely to be suspected.... The Temple affair is
all arranged; but, as to the Conciergerie one, nothing is known as
yet; the last letters from the Paris agents are dated July 26th.
We are sure that the persons interested have taken measures, but
we do not know what they are. It would not be a bad plan to
have some money in reserve for this purpose. It would be dreadful
to think we had missed our chance for the sake of two or three
hundred louis, which would make 1500 guineas. Therefore each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
man ought to carry on his person about 450 louis, or 200 double-louis,
because about 50 louis would be spent in paper-money.</p>

<p>“There will also be a line of communication between France and
England, by means of M——, who resides near Dieppe, on the
coast, and who up to now has received and passed on constant communications.
We shall have to know of all the movements either
of the armies, or of the fleets, so as to direct our operations accordingly....
Circumstances have made it very dangerous to employ
foreigners, since the Decree of August 5 has banished them from
France. But what difference is there between doing a thing one’s
self and causing it to be done? The glory which one shares with
others is glory none the less so long as the great purpose is attained....
How can I be sure if this plan does succeed, it will not be
displeasing to the lady who would have liked to carry off her friends
with her own hands, and then to lead them in triumph, etc., etc.?...
But as we are concerned, not with an opera, but an operation, the
best proof of affection will be to sacrifice that glory and that joy.
And, besides, that lady will not then be running the risks which
formerly made existence hateful to me. If my friends perish in this
affair, I shall at least not have to listen to a son’s and a mother’s
reproaches for the loss of their Charlotte....”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is clear from these lines that the communications
established with the Temple and outside it were still
kept in working order against a favourable opportunity.
The agents in question were probably those who have
been already mentioned, two of whom were the bodyguards
of the Queen. But Lady Atkyns’ money had
also had its effect, even among those “Incorruptibles”
which the Revolution created in such numbers; and the
events which we shall now read of can only be explained
by the co-operation, not only of one or two isolated
persons, but of a quantity of willing helpers, cleverly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
won over, and belonging to a circle in which it could
scarcely have been hoped that they were to be found.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, the Baron d’Auerweck (whom
we last saw in Paris), judging, doubtless, that his presence
there was unavailing, went back to London. The
situation in France was more than critical. The formation
of a fresh Committee of Public Safety, the
activity of the Revolutionary Tribunals, in a word, the
Terror in full blast, rendered any stay in Paris impossible
for already suspected foreigners, and our Baron
made haste to bring to his friends all the latest
information.</p>

<p>Peltier, who was impatiently awaiting him, on communicating
his arrival to Lady Atkyns, wrote thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My heart is too full of it for me to speak to you of anything
but the arrival of my friend, the Baron d’Auerweck. He left
France two days ago, and is now here, after having run every
imaginable risk, and lost everything that could be lost.... We
have the Paris news from him up to the 23rd; the Queen was still
safe then. The Baron does not think she will be sacrificed. Danton
and the Cordeliers are for her, Robespierre and the Jacobins against.
Her fate will depend upon which of the two parties triumphs. The
Queen is being closely guarded—the King, hardly at all. The
Queen maintains a supernatural strength and dignity.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It was in London itself, at the Royal Hotel, that
Lady Atkyns received these lines. She had hastened
there so as to be better able to make inquiries.</p>

<p>But the Decree issued by the Convention, on October<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
3, ordering the indictment of the “Widow Capet,” give
a curious contradiction to the assurances given by
d’Auerweck. After all, though, who could dare to forecast
the future, and the intentions of those who were
now in power? The ultra-jacobin politicians knew less
than any one else whither Destiny was to lead them.
Had there not been some talk, a few weeks earlier, of
getting the Queen to enter into the plan of a negotiation
with Austria? So it was not surprising that
illusions with regard to her reigned in Paris as well as
among the <i>émigrés</i> in London.</p>

<p>Eleven days later Marie-Antoinette underwent a preliminary
examination at the bar of the Revolutionary
Tribunal. The suit was heard quickly, and there were
no delays. Of the seven witnesses called, the last,
Hébert, dared to bring the most infamous accusations
against her, to which the accused replied only by a disdainful
silence. Then came the official speeches of
Chaveau-Lagarde and of Tronson-Ducoudray—a mere
matter of form, for the “Austrian woman” was irrevocably
doomed.</p>

<p>On the third day, October 16, at 4.30 a.m., in the
smoky hall of the Tribunal, by the vague light of dawn,
the jury gave their verdict, “Guilty”; and sentence of
death was immediately pronounced. Just on eleven
o’clock the cart entered the courtyard of the Conciergerie
Prison, the Queen ascended, and, after the oft-described
journey, reached the Place de la Revolution.
At a quarter past twelve the knife fell upon her neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>All was over this time—all the wondrous hopes, the
last, long-cherished illusions of Lady Atkyns. The
poor lady heard of the terrible ending from Peltier.
Her friend’s letter was one cry of rage and despair,
more piercing even than that of January 21.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has killed me. I can see your anguish from here, and it
doubles my own. My anger consumes me. I have not even the
relief of tears; I cannot shed one. I abjure for ever the name of
Frenchman. I wish I could forget their language. I am in despair;
I know not what I do, or say, or write. O God! What barbarity,
what horror, what evils are with us, and what miseries are still to
come! I dare not go to you. Adieu, brave, unhappy lady!”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Many tears must have fallen on that treasured sheet.
And still, to this day, traced by Lady Atkyns’ hand,
one can read on it these words: “<i>Written after the
murder of the Queen of France.</i>”</p>

<p>Were all her efforts, then, irremediably wasted? She
refused to believe it. And at that moment two fresh
actors appeared on the scene, whose help she could
utilize. From the friendship of one, the Chevalier de
Frotté (who came to London just then), she could confidently
hope for devoted aid. The other, a stranger to
her until then, and only recently landed from the Continent,
was destined to become one of the principal
actors in the game that was now to be played.</p>

Prison (published by L. de la Sicotière, <i>Louis de Frotté et les Insurrections
Normandes</i>, vol. i. p. 429), we consider that a somewhat natural confusion has
arisen. It is, in fact, very difficult to assign any date earlier than August 6
for an attempt at the Temple; for on that date there is a letter from Peltier
addressed to Lady Atkyns at Ketteringham, and there can be no doubt that if
the lady had already left England, Peltier would have been aware of it. On
the other hand, the letter published by V. Delaporte (p. 256), and given as
written at the end of July, 1793, <i>must be subsequent to August 2</i>. These
phrases: “They will not promise for more than the King and the two
female prisoners of the Temple; they will do what is possible for the Queen;
<i>but everything is changed</i>, and they cannot answer for anything, and, as to
the Queen, they can say nothing as yet, for they have tried the Temple
Prison only”—these phrases plainly show that the Queen was no
longer at the Temple then. Finally, since in his letter at the beginning
of August Peltier once more tried to dissuade Lady Atkyns from coming
to Paris, it seems rational to conclude that the lady had not yet carried
out her plan.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> The testimony of the Countess MacNamara was obtained by Le Normant
des Varannes, <i>Histoire de Louis XVII.</i>, Orleans, 1890, 8vo, pp. 10-14, and he
had it from the Viscount d’Orcet, who had known the Countess. Although
we cannot associate ourselves with the writer’s conclusions, we must acknowledge
that whenever we have been able to examine comparatively the statements
of Viscount d’Orcet relating to Lady Atkyns we have always found
them verified by our documents.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> It has been sought to establish a connection between this story and the
conspiracy of the Municipal, Michouis (the “Affair of the Carnation”), aided
by the Chevalier de Pougevide, which failed by the fault of one of the two
gendarmes who guarded the Queen. There may be some connection between
the principal actors in these simultaneous attempts, but we admit that we
have been unable to get any proof of it. It was necessary to take so many
precautions, to avoid as far as possible any written allusions, and to veil so
impenetrably the machinery of the plots, that it is not surprising that the
documents, curt and dry as they are, reveal to us so few details.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br><span class="small">THE ODYSSEY OF A BRETON MAGISTRATE</span></h2>
</div>



<p>On December 8, 1740, in the Rue de Montfort, at
Rennes, there were great rejoicings in one of the finest
houses of that provincial capital. Monsieur Yves-Gilles
Cormier, one of the rich citizens, had become the father
of an heir the night before; and this heir was to be
named Yves-Jean-François-Marie. The delighted father
was getting ready to go to the Church of Saint-Sauveur
(about two steps from his abode), there to present his
son for the Sacrament of Holy Baptism.</p>

<p>He had invited to this solemnity his relative, Master
(Messire) Jean-François Cormier, Prior and Rector of
Bazouges-du-Desert,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and his neighbour, the Director
of the Treasury in the States of Brittany, M. de Saint-Cristan.
Madame Françoise Lecomte, wife of the
<i>Sieur</i> Imbault, Chief Registrar of the Chamber of La
Tournelle, in the Parliament of Brittany, and Dame
Marie-Anne Lardoul were also among the guests, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
enhanced by their presence the splendour of the ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
When the bells rang out the <i>cortège</i> was
entering the church porch; shortly afterwards it
reissued thence, and went towards the house attached to
the Treasury of Brittany, where Mme. Cormier (formerly
au Egasse du Boulay) was impatiently awaiting their
return.</p>

<p>The Cormiers were a family highly respected at
Rennes. By his own labours, Yves Cormier had made a
fine fortune, which placed him and his above any kind
of need. Four years later a second child, a daughter
this time, was born. She was given the names of
Françoise-Michelle-Marie.</p>

<p>Yves-François grew up, a worker like his father, a sage
follower of parental advice, and both intelligent end
gifted. After leaving school he entered the Law
Schools at Rennes, and before he was twenty he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
got his degree and been entered (on August 18, 1760)
as a barrister. Less than a year later the position of
Crown Counsel at Rennes falling vacant, the young
barrister applied for it, his youth notwithstanding, and
obtained it (by Lettres de provision) on August 10,
1761.</p>

<p>This was a rapid advance in his career, and his
parents might justly be proud of it; but fortune meant
to lavish very special favours on the young magistrate,
for on October 27 in the following year, another position
falling vacant in the same department—that of
Crown Prosecutor—Yves Cormier, exchanging the
sitting magistracy for the standing, obtained the
place. Crown Prosecutor at twenty-two! This was
a good beginning.</p>

<p>For fifteen years he practised at Rennes. That town
was going through troublous times. The arrival of the
Duc d’Aiguillon as Governor, and his conduct in that
position, created an uproar in the ancient city, jealous,
as it had always been, of its liberties. The states proclaimed
themselves injured in their rights. Led by La
Chalotais, they obstinately fought against the claims of
the King’s representative, the Duke d’Aiguillon. And
there ensued an interminable paper-war—pamphlets,
libels, insults—which did not cease even with the
imprisonment of La Chalotais and his followers.
Ancient quarrels against the Jesuits were mixed
up with these complaints of the encroachments of
Royal; and the angry Chalotistes ended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
by accusing them of being the cause of all their
misfortunes.</p>

<p>It was naturally impossible for the Crown Prosecutor
to escape being mixed up in a business which caused
such rivers of ink to flow, and created such an endless
succession of lawsuits. A police report accused him
“of having ‘done a job’ in the La Chalotais affair.”
But he had only played a very passive part in it. His
name only figures once<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> in the voluminous <i>dossiers</i> so
meticulously rummaged through of late years; and that
is in a defamatory pamphlet (which, moreover, was torn
and burnt by parliamentary decree), denouncing him as a
participator in those Jesuit Assemblies, upon which the
full wrath of the Breton parliamentarians descended.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
The utmost one can say is that Cormier perhaps inclined
towards the Duc d’Aiguillon’s party, which,
moreover, his position as Crown Prosecutor more or
less obliged him to do.</p>

<p>Was it at that time that he began to pay repeated
visits to Paris? Very likely. At all events, from
1776 Yves Cormier practised only intermittently. His
father was dead. He lived with his mother on the
second floor of the Rue de Montfort house. Tired of
bachelor life, the young magistrate, who was then
entering his thirty-sixth year, resolved to marry. He
had met in Paris a young lady from Nantes, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
belonged to a family of rich landowners in Saint-Domingo.
Her name was Suzanne-Rosalie de Butler;
she was a little younger than he, and had rooms in the
La Tour du Pin Hotel, Rue Vieille-du-Temple.</p>

<p>On July 10, 1776, in presence of notaries of the Du
Châtelet district, M. Cormier and Mademoiselle de Butler
signed their marriage contract.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> By a rather unusual
clause, the future husband and wife, “departing in this
respect from the custom of Paris,” declared that they
didn’t intend to sign the usual <i>communauté de biens</i>,
but that each would retain as his and her own property
whatever they brought to the marriage.</p>

<p>The husband’s property consisted of his appointment
as Crown Prosecutor at Rennes, and, further, of different
lands and estates which his father had bequeathed to
him, at and near Rennes, and, finally, in “his furniture,
linen, wearing-apparel, etc., which were stored in his
place of abode.” The magistrate’s wardrobe was remarkably
well stocked, to judge by the enumeration we
give below.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> It must have been a difficult matter to
choose between the “winter, spring, autumn, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
summer garments;” the breeches of “velvet patterned
with large flowers,” or with “little bouquets”; the
coats of purple cloth, grey cloth, embroidered <i>gourgouran</i>,
black-and-olive taffetas, or green <i>musulmane</i>!
And then there were jewels, and there were carriages
for one person called <i>désobligeantes</i>, to say nothing of
hats, frills, and lace cuffs.</p>

<p>Nor did Mlle. de Butler fall in any way below this
standard. Her father, Count Jean-Baptiste Butler,
deceased, had bequeathed her, in joint tenancy with her
brother, Patrice, a rich state in Saint-Domingo, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the most flourishing colonies at that time. This state
was the farm and dwelling-house of Bois-de-Lance in
the parish of Sainte-Anne de Limonade, “with the
negroes, negresses, negro-boys and negro-girls; pieces
of furniture; utensils, riggings, horses, beasts, and all
other effects of any kind whatever, being on the said
estate.” This document recalls the state of slavery
in which the Colony then was. By a second marriage
Comte de Butler had had a son, Jean-Pantaléon,
who was thus the half-brother of the future Mme.
Cormier, and who had also some liens on the property
in question.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Suzanne de Butler further brought her
husband some estates in France, arising from her father’s
succession; and a very complete array of household
furniture, which was enriched by articles in “mahogany,
tulip-wood, and the wood peculiar to the island,” etc.</p>

<p>The marriage was celebrated some days later. Once
settled at Paris, it became difficult for the Crown Prosecutor
to keep his appointment at Rennes. Nevertheless,
he did not resign it until January 23, 1779. Two
years earlier their first child had been born, a boy, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
was baptized at the Madeleine in Paris, and named
Achille-Marie. The parents were probably at that time
living in the enormous house which Mme. Cormier
bought in the following year, No. 15 in the Rue Basse-du-Rempart.
It was a handsome house with a courtyard
and several entrances.</p>

<p>On March 10, 1779, arrived another son, who was
called Patrice, after his maternal uncle. His godmother
was a sister of Mme. Cormier, married to a former
naval officer.</p>

<p>The management of his own estates, and, more
particularly, those of his wife, occupied the greater part
of Cormier’s time in the years preceding the Revolution.
Of middle height, inclining to stoutness, with greyish
hair and an energetic type of face, the sometime Breton
magistrate was quite a personality, for he spoke remarkably
well, and, besides being most intelligent, had a real
gift of persuasion. The times that were now at hand
seemed likely to provide him with a prominent position
on the revolutionary scene.</p>

<p>We know that, in view of the elections to the States-General,
a Royal Ordinance of April 13, 1789, had
decreed the provisional division of Paris into sixty districts.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
A year later this mode of division, being no
longer useful, was replaced by a division into forty-eight
sections—those sections which, from August 10 onwards,
were to exercise so potent a political influence. Cormier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
was active from the very first. The section of the
Place Vendôme had scarcely been formed before he
occupied a prominent position therein. We see him first
as Commissary of the Section, then as President of its
Civil Committee. The General Assembly held its meetings
in the old Church of the Capuchins in the Place
Vendôme; and Cormier, whose home was close by, took
part in the deliberations. He would have played a
more active part if other business had not taken up
most of his time.</p>

<p>Amongst the numerous monarchical clubs which then
sprang up in Paris, one had just been founded whose
members, for the most part rich planters from Saint-Domingo,
used to meet in the Place des Victoires, at
the Hôtel Massiac. Their object was to counterbalance
what they held to be the pernicious influence exercised
by a new society originating in England. This was
the <i>Friends of the Blacks</i>, and had for its principal
object the amelioration of the coloured race.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The
movement, begun by Wilberforce across the Channel,
met with many adherents in France, for it accorded well
with the new ideas of enfranchisement and liberty proclaimed
by the National Assembly. This very soon
became clear to the landowners of the Leeward Islands,
who lived on the labour of their slaves, and whose whole
well-being depended on their continued existence as
such. Saint-Domingo was then in a state of astonishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
prosperity. The sugar plantations and the cultivation
of indigo and cotton had made it one of the chief
colonies. If Wilberforce’s theories were to prevail
there, it was all over with the planters and the white
people, who formed the minority of the population.</p>

<p>Founded on August 20, 1789, the Hôtel Massiac
Club intended to oppose with all its strength the current
of sympathy for the blacks, which threatened to overflow
the Assembly. Its members meant to prevent at
any cost the concession of rights to the mulattos
inhabiting the island, which would be the preliminary
to granting similar rights to the slaves. And for three
years the planters devoted all their energies to this task.</p>

<p>Cormier, as a landowner in Saint-Domingo, was, of
course, in accord with his compatriots. On August 24,
1789, he was made a member of the club, and a fortnight
later he was occupying the position of vice-president.
After a period of absence—his name disappeared from
the proceedings for several months—he reappeared at
the sittings at the commencement of 1791. From that
time forth he played a foremost part in the club; had
charge of all its correspondence and papers; and these,
now lying in the National Archives, have yielded us a
quantity of letters and speeches, and many memoranda
covered with his microscopic handwriting. In the spring
he was made president of the club; and the position was
no sinecure. Tragic news arrived from Saint-Domingo
during the summer. At the end of August there was
a rising of the mulattos and negroes, and the angry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
populace burned and pillaged the plantations, and
massacred the white folk, male and female.</p>

<p>The Colonists, very inferior in numbers as they were,
were powerless to resist them, and clamoured for help
from their compatriots and for support from the
Assembly. Letters came to the club, more terrifying
every day; the planters were in despair. Many of
them had their families out there, and they shuddered
to think of their dear ones at the mercy of the blacks.</p>

<p>The club held many extra meetings and discussions,
but every effort that was made by its members met
with furious opposition in the Assembly. At last, in
desperation, they resolved to write and despatch an
address to the King, pointing out to him the deplorable
state of the Colony, and appealing for his intervention.
The address, which was probably the work
of Cormier, after having depicted the calamities which
were overwhelming Saint-Domingo, hinted at the cause
of these woes; they were (it pointed out) a direct
sequence from the recent Decrees of the Assembly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For three years it has been the untiring aim of the Assembly to
sow broadcast in our midst the seeds of trouble and revolt. In vain
we multiply our efforts to escape their snares; and now a society
founded by foreigners and cranks for our ruin and the humiliation
of France, and using ignorance and credulity for its pernicious ends,
is inundating us with incendiary writings, and flaunting its emissaries
in our very workshops.”</p>
</div>

<p>The planters, for all their impassioned denunciation,
had proved powerless to avert the detested action of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the Friends of the Blacks; therefore they now brought
the King to take their part.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our cause is that of all the American Colonies; our cause is
that of French Commerce, which must inevitably be ruined if we
are ruined; our cause is that of the creditors of the State, whom
these events will bring to bankruptcy; our cause is that of six
millions of men employed directly or indirectly in the navigation,
the commerce, and the victualling of the Colonies; our cause is that
of the monarchy, which will lose all splendour when we are no
longer wealthy, which will lose all power on the sea if we are to
perish. Sire, you are the Supreme Head of the Executive, you are
the preserver of the Public Peace, and the guardian of the public
rights. We beseech your Majesty to take the French Colonies
under your protection. We beseech you, while our total ruin is not
yet consummated, to oppose your authority to the new designs of
these men, who will never be satisfied until they have filled our cup
of misery to the brim. We ask for powerful aid for our almost
despairing brethren; we ask for the most searching inquiries, and
the most elaborate justice upon the authors of these cabals.”</p>
</div>

<p>There were a hundred signatures of Colonists and
members of the club to this bold and convincing manifesto
of Cormier’s, when it was read at the session of
November. First, it “was decided to print 3000 copies
to be sent broadcast throughout France.”</p>

<p>On the next day, Wednesday, towards eleven o’clock
a.m., a group of black-garbed men assembled at the
Tuileries Palace, in the Hall of the Nobles. As each
arrived, he was presented by one of their party—a
broad-shouldered, energetic-looking personage—to a
gentleman before whom each bowed respectfully: this
was M. Bertrand de Molleville, Minister of the King,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
and head of the Naval Department. The men thus
severally presented to him were none other than the
members of the Massiac Club, <i>headed</i> by their President,
M. Cormier. When every one had arrived, they
set off towards the Royal apartments. The King was
in his study. The Colonists were permitted to enter,
and were then presented one after the other to His
Majesty, after which Cormier began to speak:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sire, the news from Saint-Domingo has caused consternation
among the Colonists of that unhappy land. But confident of your
Majesty’s sentiments towards them, and assured of that fatherly
solicitude of which France has already enjoyed so many touching
evidences, they have set forth their fears and their desires in the
address which they have the honour to present to you. They
implore your Majesty’s gracious consideration of it.”</p>
</div>

<p>The King, when he had been informed of the
calamitous events in the Colony, tried, in a voice full
of emotion, to calm the anxiety which he saw in every
face. “I still hope, gentlemen,” he said to them,
“that the evils are not so great as rumour would have
them. I shall see that all measures are taken to give
powerful help to the Colonists in the shortest possible
time.” And in speaking privately to one or two of the
delegates he reaffirmed these promises of succour.</p>

<p>Their business finished, the planters were about to
withdraw, when somebody suggested a further appeal,
this time to the Queen. The proposal was eagerly
acclaimed, and Count de Duras brought almost directly
an affirmative reply. Without going back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
courtyard, but by way of the Royal apartments, the
visitors were conducted to the ground-floor, and found
themselves in presence of the Queen. Cormier spoke—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Madame, in our time of great misfortune, we felt the need of
seeing your Majesty, that by so doing we might both find consolation
and study an example of lofty courage.”</p>
</div>

<p>Marie-Antoinette, more moved than even the King
had been, replied in a broken voice, striving to repress
her tears—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Gentlemen, be assured of the interest that we take in your
misfortunes, and assure ... the Colony also ... that the King
will leave no stone unturned to send them——”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>
</div>

<p>She was unable to finish; the anguish of those
before her, the thought that they also were watching
in agonizing uncertainty the ruin of their dearest
hopes—such a communion of kindred suffering was
too much for the Queen. Moreover, what now could
be done by the fugitives of Varennes? Every day
it was growing clearer that they were prisoners in
this Tuileries Palace.</p>

<p>The Queen left them, to hear Mass. During her
absence Mme. de Tourzel, the Dauphin’s governess,
happened to enter the apartment where the planters
still lingered, thrilled and touched by the scene that
had just taken place. She presented the little Dauphin
to them. He opened his eyes wide at the sight of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the black coats. “Monseigneur was very, very sorry,”
said Mme. de Tourzel, “when he was told of all the
sad things that are happening in the Colony; he feels
very deeply for all the sorrows of the gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed I do,” said the Dauphin, in his little
voice.</p>

<p>One can imagine the impression which would have
been left by this picture upon these serious men, come
to invoke their Sovereign’s aid, and most of whom were
ardent defenders of the Royalist cause. Their president,
in particular, was never to forget this reception;
and the vision of the little Duke of Normandy, with
his fair curling hair, his clear eyes, and his ineffably
sweet expression, was to remain for ever in the man’s
heart. Perhaps he heard, later on, the charming story
that Mme. de Tourzel tells in her memoirs, of how,
when the delegates were gone, and the Dauphin alone
with his mother, he was told in a few words of the
Colonists’ misfortunes, and forthwith begged her to
give him their address.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with it?” the Queen
asked him.</p>

<p>“I want to put it in my left pocket, because that’s
the nearest to my heart.”</p>

<p>Before finally withdrawing, the delegates went also
to Mme. Elizabeth, who received them with equal sympathy.
They were leaving the palace, when, on passing
in front of the chapel, they met with the Queen,
who was returning to her apartments, after having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
heard Mass. “Gentlemen,” she said to them, “I
was not able to answer you just now, but the cause
of my silence will have spoken to you eloquently
enough.”</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day, in their night-session,
the planters broke into applause at the reading
of the account of their visit to the Tuileries. What a
memory it was! And yet, how much they had still to
fear! They had been able to read between the lines of
the kindly Royal speeches; they knew that the goodwill
of their Sovereigns would have to encounter the
hostile intentions of the National Assembly, and that
the promised help would be long in coming. And, in
fact, the Decree of December 7, while ordering the
despatch of troops, put a very stringent limitation to
their powers, and confirmed the rights accorded to the
coloured races.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the club did not lose heart. Its
activity during the winter and spring of 1792 is proved
by a copious correspondence, and many reports of sessions,
presided over with praiseworthy care and regularity
by the sometime magistrate of Rennes. These
strenuous functions, however, did not prevent him from
fulfilling his civil duties. We find him mounting
guard, like others, at the guard-house of the headquarters
of his section,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and attending the meetings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
that section where he is a member of the Civil
Committee.</p>

<p>Another winter, that of 1792, goes by, and alarming
symptoms in the spring of ’93 seem to indicate that the
year is not to end tranquilly. In Paris political life is
the only life; the effervescence grows and grows. The
difficulty of provisioning the capital, the dearness of
food, and the consequent great distress, bring about a
state of instability and demoralization which is bound
to express itself in action, and which will break out on
the slightest pretext. Moreover, the people, already
indignant, are exasperated by the flight of so many
nobles from the kingdom—a flight which serves to
reinforce the <i>émigré</i> contingent.</p>

<p>Cormier perceives the gravity of the situation. Two
alternatives present themselves to him—either to leave
Paris and the country and join those who are working
at the frontiers for the restoration of the Monarchy, or
to win over the Western Department, in which, however,
revolt is already brewing. If this breaks out it
will be a most formidable insurrection. The second
plan will have the advantage of taking him to the
neighbourhood of Rennes, where he still has interests;
and, after a period of waiting, he can, according to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
course of events, either place his abilities at the service
of the Royalist cause, or retire definitely from active life.</p>

<p>And there is nothing to keep him in Paris. The
members of the Massiac Club are the objects of daily-increasing
suspicion on the part of the “patriots.”
These “aristocrats” have got themselves detested for
their obstinate self-defence, for their tenacious hold
upon their properties, and for their continued struggle
for the maintenance of slavery. If things go on as
they are doing now, in a few months the club will be
so universally attacked that its only course will be to
close its doors. In these circumstances Cormier does not
hesitate. He will leave his wife at Paris; she is a
sensible woman, full of resource—<i>she</i> will know how to
take care of the house in the Rue Basse-du-Rempart,
and, supported by her younger son, she may in the
future be of the greatest assistance to the party.</p>

<p>Desirous of completing their elder son’s education,
the Cormiers had sent him, a year before this, to Hamburg;
he there spent six months with a worthy citizen
of the Place Schaarmarkt;<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and then left, to go to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
little town of Itzehoë, in Holstein, where he continued
his studies.</p>

<p>So everything seemed to confirm Cormier in his intention.
On June 25, 1792, he begged his colleague, M.
de Grandchamp, to represent him as President—“for a
fortnight;” and, by way of excuse, he pointed out that
it was the first time he had been away for four years.
We then lose sight of him for some days, and when we
next encounter him, he is settled, from the end of July
onwards, in Brittany, at Gaël, near Montfort. It
would be difficult to account for this sojourn in a remote
locality if we did not recollect that the sometime Crown
Prosecutor had inherited several estates from his father
in that neighbourhood; and where could he have found
a safer or more tranquil retreat than in one of these,
during that troublous period which followed June 20,
when the proclamation of the “Country in Danger”
disturbed the whole of France, and drums were beating
in all the towns and countrysides—when, in a word, the
<i>Tenth of August</i> was at hand? Just before that bloody
dawn, there arrived at Madame Cormier’s house an
official-looking personage, escorted by a quartermaster
of the National Gendarmerie. She had been anticipating
something of the kind for so long that she knew at
once what her visitors wanted. In reply to her
questions, the stranger, who was no other than a Commissary
of the Place Vendôme section, displayed a
warrant for arrest from the Surveillance Committee of
the National Assembly, issued in due form against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
President of the Colonial Club. “He had not expected
any such visit, and was away from home, at Calais,”
answered “the lady his wife;” and that being so, the
Commissary, to make up for it, had to request that he
might be taken to M. Cormier’s room, and, once there,
proceeded to make a thorough search in every corner of
it. When he had made a clean sweep of all the papers
he found, tied them up in bundles, and deposited them in
two band-boxes, he took it into his head to move away
the fire-screen. In the grate a heap of blackened paper
was still smoking. He had been too late for that, also.</p>

<p>Cormier had clearly been happily inspired to get off
in time. Although he could not exactly have been
accused of conspiring against the public safety, still the
mere fact of his position makes it doubtful that, once
arrested, he would have escaped the “Septemberers,”
who in a few weeks’ time were to commence the chapter
of their exploits.</p>

<p>He judged it prudent not to leave his retreat at Gaël
before the spring of 1793. At Paris, the tempest still
raged, most assuredly not calmed by the King’s death;
in the provinces—added to other causes, such as the
general rising and the application of the Civil Constitution
to the clergy—the execution of “Louis Capet” led to an
outbreak of “Chouannerie:” it was at that very moment,
indeed, that the Insurrection in La Vendée exploded,
captained by those brilliant chiefs, Stofflet, Cathelineau,
Bonchamp, and Larochejaquelein. At the news of their
rapid successes, Cormier, called on by them, quitted Gaël;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
and if we are to believe the certificates “of presence”
given by the Vendean generals, it was he who directed
the correspondence of the Royalist Army during the
early operations.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The former President of the Massiac
Club was very much in his element among such active
and varied functions, requiring a systematic brain. His
pen never rests; his letters, addresses, orders, teem in
the insurgent districts, and yet his name remains unknown;
one scarcely comes across it even in the abundant
publications devoted to the history of Chouannerie.
The defeat of Mans in December, 1793, when a part of
the Catholic and Royal Army was routed, did not cool
Cormier’s zeal. The theatre of war was altered, that
was all. He went nearer to Rennes, and “worked” in
the districts of Fougères and of Rennes. If we believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the aforementioned certificates, he did not desist from
his labours during the months and years that followed.
Both before and after the pacification of La Mabilais,
Cormier, according to them, had continued to live in the
revolted departments, fighting in the ranks of the
Chouans. But we must not confide too much in these
testimonials, which were for the most part written and
produced for a certain very definite purpose—that of
clearing the subject of them from a charge of emigration.
By proving his share in the operations of the Vendean
Army, he proved also his presence in France. Now, the
famous “lists of the <i>émigrés</i>” contained the name of
“Cormier, father and son.” So the necessity is evident
for our magistrate to insist in any and every fashion
upon the part which he had taken in the rising at
La Vendée, even if this insistence were in absolute
opposition to the truth.</p>

<p>By a lucky chance there is other testimony to be had
(and that of undoubted authenticity), which enables us
to get at the truth of the matter. It consists of Cormier’s
own letters, written at that time. While he, some
years later, maintained that he had never quitted
French soil, we know for certain that, at the beginning
of 1794, perhaps soon after the Queen’s death, he
landed in England, and, instantly joining the restless
throng around the Princes, was soon playing a prominent
part in its midst.</p>

<p>We meet him with de Puisaye, with the Bishop of
Arras, with Dutheil, hovering around the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
Ministers and associating himself with the leaders of
the <i>émigrés</i> in trying to induce England to agree to an
effective, that is to say, an armed, intervention.</p>

<p>The history of these attempts is inextricably complex.
Ministers’ halls and corridors were crammed with unemployed
soldiers, needy nobles, agents, spies—each
with a scheme more dazzling than the others. There
were many adventurers who were never taken at any
other valuation, and whose incessant activity deceived
nobody. But there were also personages of considerable
importance, and of illustrious name, who came
there with undeniable reputations, and who could not
easily be repulsed. In the variety of their schemes
and the abundance of their offers, it is necessary to
disentangle and take into consideration all kinds of
secret motives, petty views, personal grudges, or even
jealousies, against their compatriots. Every one wanted
to act, and every one wanted the best part; and as
their various rivalries displayed themselves, the general
confusion increased.</p>

<p>One of the favourite meeting-places of this set of
people was the office of Peltier, the journalist. All the
news came there; they could get the latest information
from France, and discuss the chances of the parties, the
military operations on the frontiers, and, above all, the
intentions of the British Government.</p>

<p>A quartette was soon formed in the office of the
sometime editor of the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>. It was
made up of Peltier and his second in command, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Baron d’Auerweck (whom we have already met); of
Cormier, and of a fourth arrival, who is no stranger to
us—the Chevalier Louis de Frotté.</p>

<p>After his exploits at Dunkirk, the ex-officer of the
Colonel-Generals had spent many months in the Army
of the Emigration. Accompanied by his friend and
inseparable, La Tremoïlle, he had taken part in the
first campaign of 1792, under the Duke of Brunswick.
The inexplicable retreat of this last with his 80,000
men, the lack of sympathy that the two officers felt
with the Austrians, and the incessant squabbles that
went on, disgusted them with the whole affair. They
left for Italy, and reached Milan and Turin—not without
adventures on the way; then, in the spring following,
they re-entered Condé’s army, which was now in
the Emperor’s pay.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Fresh vexations awaited them
there—for the general Royalist rising that had been
arranged to come off simultaneously at Lyons, in the
South, and in the Jura, fell through in a pitiable
fashion. And from La Vendée there came, on the
other hand, the news of many successes by the
Chouans.</p>

<p>Frotté made up his mind. He would go and rejoin
his compatriots; he would come to France itself and
fight the Revolution there. To do this, a short stay
in England was indispensable. He could obtain resources
there, and he had none at the moment. Who
could say that he might not even be entrusted with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
official command? At any rate, that was how, in the
early months of 1794, the Chevalier de Couterne came
to disembark at London like the rest. We shall not be
surprised, knowing as we do his relations with Lady
Atkyns, and <i>her</i> relations with Peltier and d’Auerweck,
to find Frotté very quickly made free of that
little circle of intimates.</p>

<p>His admiration for his fair friend of Lille was far
from having decreased; and he now listened to the
details, by her own lips, of her repeated offers for, and
her unalterable devotion to, the Royal family. He
even came, under her influence, to share the hopes
which she, brave lady! still cherished.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br><span class="small">THE MYSTERY OF THE TEMPLE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Amidst the medley of feelings produced upon her
mind by all the events happening in Paris—all the
insurrectionary outbreaks, all the plottings and arrests—neither
Lady Atkyns nor her friends withdrew their
gaze from the prison of the Temple. As though this
edifice with its four towers exercised some mysterious
attraction, extending far and wide, their thoughts
returned persistently to this one spot, hidden away in
the enclosures of the old palace and closed in by a network
of other structures. What news was there of the
happenings within those sinister high walls? Baron
d’Auerweck, who was the best-informed, having just
come from the Continent, retailed all that he had
gathered from public rumours and from personal inquiries
which his relations with people inside the prison
enabled him to make.</p>

<p>Madame Elizabeth and her niece still lived in the
suite occupied by the Queen. The little Dauphin had
been snatched away from his mother on the night of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
July 3, 1793, and handed over to the care of the bootmaker,
Antoine Simon. Simon and his wife—as a
recent work has made quite clear—were very far from
being guilty of the cruelties to the child attributed to
them by tradition. Chosen for his task by Chaumette,
whose authority at the Temple was supreme, and
looking up to him as his master, Simon was a rough
specimen, uncouth somewhat in his ways, and too fond
of the bottle, violently republican in his sentiments, but
at bottom a decent fellow, and not wantonly cruel nor
ill-natured. His wife is shown to have had a good
heart; she had been seen at the bootmakers’ hospital,
where her conduct won the praise of all, working very
actively and thoroughly at her task. She was known
to be a great chatterbox. Such as she was, Madame
Simon undoubtedly felt much sympathy with the child
confided to her care.</p>

<p>What did Simon and his wife do with the young
Dauphin? Did he fade away in their hands, into the
living spectre, the martyr succumbing to blows and
bruises that the Eckards and de Beauchesnes and
Chantelauzes would have us believe? Assuredly not.
Doubtless the complete change in his existence, the
sense of being closed in and confined, must have told
upon the small prisoner. After the splendours of
Versailles, it must have been hard upon him to be
subjected at once to so severe a <i>régime</i> and to have for
company a household of vulgar, common people, without
education. And tears must have coursed down his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
cheeks. But there is a gulf between this and the
stories of systematic cruelties, and we may well refuse
to believe in anything of this kind until ample proof is
forthcoming.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on January 19, 1794, it became known in
the Temple <i>quartier</i> that the Simons were giving up
their functions and settling down somewhere else.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
What was the reason of this? Explanations differ. It
is certain that Simon had no heart for his duties, and
that he must have emitted a sigh of satisfaction when
he left the Temple. He showed the child before he
quitted to the four men who were told off to replace
him, and received from them a voucher to the effect
that he was in good health.</p>

<p>Henceforth, for the next six months, the Dauphin is
to be immured in his prison, and no one is to penetrate
within; the door of his cell is to be bolted and barred,
and food is to be ministered to him through a grille.
The four Commissioners of the Commune entrusted
with his care will take it turn about to spy at him
through the peep-hole in the door, but none of them
will set foot inside.</p>

<p>What are we to think of this confinement? What
was the meaning of it? We feel that it is out of the
question at this time of day to formulate any clear-cut
explanation of it. So great an air of mystery hangs
over all that happened in the Temple during this year of
1794 and down to June 8, 1795, that it would be vain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
to attempt to elucidate this imbroglio of deeds plotted
in the dark, and performed by actors each of whom
played his part independently of the others. The
various personages mixed up in them were so situated
that they could not see the goal towards which they
were called upon to work. What we desire to do, with
the help of the correspondence at our disposal, is to
show that Lady Atkyns was the leading spirit of a
Royalist Committee, formed for the purpose of securing
the Dauphin’s escape, and that not only his escape was
practicable, thanks to the intervention of people high in
authority—probably of Barras—but that it was, in fact,
carried out.</p>

<p>A sort of bureau had been instituted at Paris for
turning to account the sources of information contrived
within the Temple, and for keeping <i>au courant</i> with the
prison regulations and the methods adopted for watching
over the Royal captive. There was a house in
Rue Basse-du-Rempart in which M. Cormier lived
formerly, and which, on setting out for La Vendée, he
left to the care of his wife.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> In this house they had a
<i>pied à terre</i> ready to their hands, and in Mme. Cormier,
<i>née</i> de Butler, a person on whom they could absolutely
rely, active-minded, enterprising, the very person of all
others to help the projects of the Royalists in London.
It is she who, during these first weeks of the year 1794,
will be keeping her husband and his friends <i>au courant</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
with all she can find out about the Dauphin and his
gaolers, and the way in which he and his now numerous
partisans in Paris are kept under watch. It is impossible
for her, we may be sure, to correspond direct with
London, and we are in the dark as to her methods of
communication; but in these days there are any
number of couriers carrying news and despatches from
the Continent to England. Soon, to avoid suspicion
and work in greater safety, Mme. Cormier, henceforth
referred to always by her maiden name, will secure a
decree of divorce from her husband on the ground that
he is <i>émigré</i>, thus apparently breaking up all connection
with the former president of the Club Massiac.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Had
she not had her name removed already, a year earlier,
from the ill-fated list of <i>émigrés</i>?</p>

<p>It is time for us now to make fuller acquaintance
with the members of this circle of intimate friends
surrounding Lady Atkyns, and concentrating all their
efforts upon the furthering of her plans.</p>

<p>Two figures stand out conspicuously: M. de Cormier
and the Chevalier de Frotté. These alone have been
let into the secret of the first operations; these alone
can claim to have full knowledge of the desires and
hopes of the Queens friend. Cormier, “our big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
friend,” as he is designated in their correspondence, is
a strong support. His experience, his good sense, his
relations with the English Government, inspire confidence
at first sight in all who are brought into contact
with the corpulent Breton, and all are quickly won
over by the charm of his fluent and persuasive speech.
Despite authentic certificates of residence, according to
which his son has not quitted Holstein, where he is by
way of pursuing his studies during this and the following
year, the ex-magistrate has not been willing to
forego his son’s companionship, and there are constant
allusions to him in his letters. A prey to frequent
attacks of gout, Cormier requires to have some one
at hand to look after him affectionately.</p>

<p>Frotté, a man of some intellect, with a fine presence
and a martial air about him, and with the advantage of
being acquainted with the recent happenings in Normandy
and La Vendée, is well fitted for helping Lady
Atkyns in her plans. He also has been able to get into
intimate relations with the Government, to secure a
hearing for his views, and thus to acquire real influence.
In these two men Lady Atkyns possesses powerful
lieutenants, who henceforth will be indispensable to
her, and to whom she will have to unfold her ideas
impartially and equally. For while each of them is
eager to devote himself entirely to her enterprise, little
by little, imperceptibly almost, and according as difficulties
crop up in their path, feelings of jealousy and
envy will make themselves evident between the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>By length of service, and by reason of so many
tender remembrances therewith connected, Frotté considers
himself entitled to the premier place in the
confidence and regard of his fair friend. His letters
are full of burning affection and admiration for her, to
whom he is ready to sacrifice everything.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is only in your society,” he writes, “that I am my real self.
You are in possession of all my secrets, and you share all those
feelings which cause me to have any joy in life and for which none
the less I should be ready to die. Adieu! Do you understand
me? What am I to think of the heroine to whom I devote my
entire future and who may make all my life’s happiness? Do you
understand me? Adieu! If I speak to ears and to a heart that
refuse to listen to me ... then I am not at the end of my troubles.
Oh, most charming of women, whatever may be the outcome of this
Revolution of ours—even though you should have no share in it—you
will ever be in my eyes the tender and devoted friend of
Antoinette, the woman who would have sacrificed everything for
the Queen’s son, the woman to whom I would fain owe all my
happiness.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Side by side with these two men we find a third
individual, whose name recurs very often in the conversation,
and who will also play his part. The Baron
d’Auerweck, the “little baron,” comes to offer his
services to Lady Atkyns, and to profit by her generosity,
which he knows to be inexhaustible. He is not
to be admitted into all the secrets of the committee—he
is to be spoken to in general terms. D’Auerweck, with
his philosophical whims and unceasing chatter, bombards
his benefactress with his letters, in which he retails to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
her all the rumours current in London regarding the
child in the Temple. On intimate terms with the
journalist Peltier, d’Auerweck acts as his collaborator,
so to speak, keeping him <i>au courant</i> with the progress
of the enterprise as far as he is in a position to do so.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the Bishop of Saint-Pol-de-Léon.
The bishop has not broken off his relations with the
indefatigable lady, for whom he professes an immense
admiration. His assistance is by no means to be
despised, for among the ever-increasing crowds of <i>émigrés</i>
now pressing to London there are quite a number
of persons who are under obligations to him. When
Lady Atkyns leaves Ketteringham and comes to stay
for a time among her friends, we find the venerable
prelate visiting her on several occasions.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>She entertains him with an account of the steps she
is taking. Little by little her money will be exhausted;
but what matter provided she succeeds? Not content
with seeing her gold dispensed at Paris by her paid
supporters, the generous Englishwoman has made up
her mind to acquire a ship which she has had secured
for herself by an <i>émigré</i>, the Baron de Suzannet, and
which had been entirely rigged out at her expense.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
This vessel plies continually between the English coast
and the continent, after January, 1794; her captain is
instructed to communicate by means of signs agreed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
upon with people stationed along the French coast,
generally at Dieppe. In this way news can always be
conveyed from Paris, while the ship will be ready at
the right moment to pick up the young Dauphin and
carry him off into security.</p>

<p>This was the condition of things at the beginning of
1794, when, on Monday, March 24, Cormier received a
piece of news which at first unbalanced him. His wife
had been arrested in Paris, and there was nothing to
indicate how this mishap had come about.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What terrible news, Madame!” he wrote to Lady Atkyns;
“my wife has been arrested! I am inconsolable. I know no
details as yet.”</p>
</div>

<p>On reflection, however, he realizes that the nature of
his former duties, taken in conjunction with his present
position as an <i>émigré</i>, suffice to account for what had
taken place.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is every reason to believe,” he proceeds, “that nothing
has been discovered regarding our plot, and that it is merely as the
wife of the President of the Massiac Club that she has been put
under arrest. At least, I flatter myself that this is so. If I get
no news here, I shall set out for the place where news will be
forthcoming soonest. Nothing will ever make me abandon our
project and the object of our desires. You shall have my news at
the earliest possible moment, either from here or from Choram.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now, on this very day Hébert was mounting the
scaffold, a victim to the accusations of Robespierre,
whose despotism was triumphant. He who had been to
a great extent responsible for looking after Louis XVII.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
had now fallen in his turn, to be followed a few weeks
later (April 13) by his friend Chaumette. Here is
what Cormier had to say on the subject—the news had
reached him with wonderful speed—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Robespierre has triumphed over the others, and he has had
Hébert, Vincent, etc., arrested and guillotined. Robespierre had
declared himself anxious to stop the flow of blood ...; he had
spoken up for the prisoners in the Temple. Fresh letters are
arriving here. It is certain, I think, that my wife has not yet been
charged with anything, or even suspected of anything in regard to
the prisoners.”</p>
</div>

<p>The event was inopportune. Cormier had just decided
to leave London for the coast, where he was to receive
certain information and to take counsel with his agents.
Now his plans were all upset. He would have to
postpone the journey and redouble his precautions.</p>

<p>At the end of five days there was ground for taking
a hopeful view of things. There was every reason to
believe that Mme. Cormier’s arrest would not have any
grave results.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What annoys me most,” writes Cormier to Lady Atkyns on
March 28, “is the fact that the news had got back to Paris, with
commentaries which may do harm both to my wife and to our
affairs.”</p>
</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, Peltier and d’Auerweck hastened,
on hearing of what had happened, to convey their
sympathy to their friend, and, like true journalists,
spread the tidings in every direction, thus intensifying
Cormier’s uneasiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But I must only try and put aside this anxiety,” he continues,
“as I have so many others. I have not yet started; I shall not
start before Monday or Tuesday, because I must wait for replies
from Dieppe, which cannot arrive before Sunday or Monday. Have
no fears; my courage will not fail me—indeed, at present it is taking
the shape of a feeling of rage, which I am trying to keep down. You
will have learnt from the public prints that the statement has gone
out that the King has been carried off to the army of the Prince of
Saxe-Coburg. This false report has troubled me a good deal. I
don’t want attention to be directed that way just now, especially
as something has happened which would increase our confidence—something
which I cannot at present confide to paper. Do not
exert yourself too much, madame; do not measure your efforts by
your courage. Your friends beg this of you.”</p>
</div>

<p>In all these letters of the Breton magistrate there is
a real ring of sincerity. The admiration he feels for
this interesting woman resolves itself into a whole-hearted
devotion to her cause, and if, later, her large
fortune and her generosity seem to have too large a
part in Cormier’s thoughts and too great an influence
upon his actions, at least he must be credited with
absolute frankness throughout.</p>

<p>The death of Sir Edward Atkyns on March 27, 1794,
gave Cormier an opportunity for expressing his sympathy
with the widow, and of enlarging still further upon his
feelings. The scant mention made of Sir Edward,
indeed, in the correspondence of this little circle suggests
that the relations between husband and wife must have
become perceptibly colder of late. It is probable that
the baronet looked with disfavour upon his wife’s
schemes and the heavy outlay they entailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A score of times,” writes Cormier, “I have taken pen in hand
this morning to express to you the intense interest with which
I have learnt of the sad event which occurred, and as often my
courage has failed me. Truly you have been the victim of many
misfortunes. Will the Fates never have done pursuing you? You
must only make use of the great qualities Providence has given you
to bear up against what has befallen. Your courage is exceptional.
Make the most of a quality which is rare with men, but rarer still
in women. As for me, I vow I shall not give in under my misfortune,
and shall not be put off by any perils.... I have not
started yet, and shall not start to-morrow, not having yet received
the letters I was expecting. If they come to-morrow, I shall start
on Thursday. So that this delay may not cause you anxiety, I may
mention that in the last letters which have come to me, he who left
last ... asks me not to start until I heard again from him. He
has not been beyond D(ieppe), and the others have returned from
P(aris) to take counsel with him—I don’t know on what.”</p>
</div>

<p>These last words show that something was already
happening on the Breton coast, and that it was desired
to send news of interest to Cormier. But the departure
postponed so often was still impracticable, and Cormier
began to lose patience.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am still kept here,” he writes. “It is becoming incensing.
I feel as though I were being chained up, but prudence and
common sense keep me quiet. I get news regularly from D(ieppe).
I have just received a third letter enjoining me to make no movement
until they give me the word, and insisting that the success of our
project and the safety of him who is so precious to us depend upon
this. I don’t understand, however, their not telling us why and how....
I have lost patience, and have sent one of these gentlemen.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
(That is not the same as myself.) I am afraid that Hamelin may
really have been killed; I can’t make it out at all.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>
<p>Who was Hamelin? It is difficult to guess. It is
difficult to identify a great many of the individuals of
whom there is question in these letters, and who are
designated by borrowed names. The most elementary
prudence called for absolute secrecy concerning the
names of the agents who were working for our committee,
and although the messages were carried by the
most trustworthy emissaries, it was always possible that
one of them might be arrested <i>en route</i>. This doubles
our difficulty in clearing up the imbroglio, and enhances
a mystery already sufficiently troublesome.</p>

<p>Failing Mme. Cormier, who was still under arrest,
and whose absence had been making itself felt more and
more, another arrangement had been made for securing
news from Paris. At what expense? Heaven knows!
But once again money had set tongues going and procured
the needed help. Cormier, coming back to the
question of his departure, writes again (April 14, 1794)
to his friend to tell her of the messages he has sent
from England:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall not start until this evening,” he tells her. “You can
guess why. I have just despatched two messengers. Things are
moving, but very slowly. However, let us not lose heart. If we
go slowly we go all the more surely, and every day achieve something
which helps to advance our schemes and to keep us in
security. Therefore do not be impatient.”</p>
</div>

<p>The weeks passed by, and that fateful day “9th
Thermidor,” which was to bring with it such a <i>bouleversement</i>
in Paris, was drawing nigh. At the Temple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
there had been no change—the Dauphin was still
sequestrated from the outside world.</p>

<p>On May 11, 1794, Robespierre visited the prison, and
had a brief interview with Marie-Therèse, but we have
no information as to what happened.</p>

<p>The 9th Thermidor arrives and throws the dictator
down from his pedestal, thereby proclaiming the end of
his reign of terror. General Barras, invested with the
command of the armed forces within the city, begins to
take an important part in the management of affairs.
One of his first acts, it will be remembered, after he
had triumphed over Robespierre’s party, was to go to the
prison of the Temple, on July the 28th, accompanied
by his brilliant staff, bedecked with gold. The miserable
aspect of the child after being shut up for months
caused the general to take immediate steps, and by his
order of July 29, 1794, a special guardian, chosen by
himself, named Laurent, a native of Martinique, was
brought to the prison, there to be entrusted with
the sole care for nearly five months of the young
Capet.</p>

<p>A careful study of the documents bearing upon this
period of the captivity of the Dauphin makes it quite
clear that in the hands of his new guardian he was
looked after in a fashion which contrasted strongly with
the previous neglect, and that he soon became attached
to Laurent, who proved himself good-natured, kind, and
even affectionate in his attitude towards his charge. If
strange things came about in the Temple at that time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
we may be certain that Laurent knew about them, and
we may assume that Barras was the prime mover in all
that happened.</p>

<p>It is impossible, as we have said before, to recapitulate
all the arguments which tend to bring home to the
general some complicity in the fate of Louis XVII.,
and which implicate a large number of persons, most of
them people of influence in the world of the Convention.
Other writers, notably M. Henri Provins,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> have done
this so conscientiously and thoroughly that there is no
need for us to attempt it. We may content ourselves
with making public a series of documents and newly
ascertained matters, the gist of which bears out exactly
all that we knew already of Laurent’s conduct at the
Temple. Lady Atkyns and her friends could not have
done without him. It is true that his name never
appears in their communications, for reasons already
given, but the striking connection between the events
within the prison walls and their effects in London
upon the Royalist Committee proves beyond doubt the
relations subsisting between them. Between the lines
of these documents we get to understand what Cormier
meant by “new combinations.” Lady Atkyns has been
at pains to say it herself in one of her notes which she
used to make upon her correspondence, and which often
serve to explain her actions.</p>

<p>In his anxiety about the future, did Cormier entertain
fears lest all remembrance of his heroine’s devotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
would vanish with her if by some mischance her enterprise
should fail, or if she herself should lose her life?
Who knows? However that may be, it is the case
that on August 1, 1794, he had two statements drawn
up (the text of which, unluckily, is not forthcoming), in
which Lady Atkyns recorded all that she had achieved
down to that date for the safety of those who were so
dear to her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These records are to my knowledge the absolute truth,” attested
Cormier at the foot of the deposition, “and I declare that ever
since I first knew Lady Atkyns, she has always shown the same
purity of principles, and that all she has here stated is true in every
particular.”</p>
</div>

<p>These documents were to have been handed over for
preservation, with a number of others, to a solicitor or
some trustworthy person in London.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, renewed efforts were being made to bring
about a good service of news to the Continent and
Paris. As time passed, Lady Atkyns’ friends realized
more and more that it would have been madness to
proceed with a regular attempt at a sudden rescue in
the actual conditions of things. In truth, the calm
which had followed the 9th Thermidor, and which gave
Paris time to take breath, was making itself felt within
the Temple. Laurent’s nomination was evidence of
this. Any attempt to act at once would have been
sheer folly. What was to be done was to “get at”
those who had any kind of influence within the Temple
or without, whilst taking care not to let too many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
people into the secret of the enterprise. Here, again,
unluckily, the wise secretiveness of all their papers
prevents us from ascertaining any names. Those who
were tempted by Lady Atkyns’ gold to compromise
themselves in any way, took too many precautions
against being found out.</p>

<p>Lady Atkyns, however, was not idle. Two sailing
vessels were continually plying between different points
on the French coast. A third, which she had recently
purchased, had orders to keep close to land between
Nantes and La Rochelle, ready at any moment to receive
the Dauphin.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The cost of keeping these three ships was considerable,
and Lady Atkyns had great difficulty in providing
the money. She was in the hands of agents whose
services, indispensable to her, could be depended upon
only so long as the sums they demanded were forthcoming.
We can imagine the feelings of anxiety and
despondency with which she must have read the
following letter from Cormier. What answer was she
to make to him? (The person to whom she had applied
for financial help appears on several occasions in their
correspondence under the designation of “le diable
noir.”)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your <i>diable noir’s</i> reply is very little consolation to me,” writes
Cormier; “he has promised and postponed so often. For Heaven’s
sake, see to it that he does not promise us this time also to no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
purpose!... I gather that you were to have two definite replies
to-day—I shall be in Purgatory until five o’clock. Mon Dieu!
Mon Dieu! I wonder what you will send me, or rather what you
will be able to send me? Our own courage alone does not suffice—we
have to keep up the courage of others, and they are losing heart.
Worst of all, there is that avaricious Jew of a captain! We are
absolutely dependent upon him. If we lost him where should we
get another to take his place? I beg of you, in the name of the
one you know, to do all you possibly can, to exert all your resources,
to prevent his having to leave me empty-handed.”</p>
</div>

<p>And to excuse the ultimatum-like tone of his letter,
Cormier adds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Forgive the urgent persistent style in which I write! But
when one is writing about business matters and matters of this
importance, one has to forget one is writing to a woman—especially
when it is a question of a Lady Atkyns, who is different from the
rest of her sex.”</p>
</div>

<p>The occasions for entering into communication with
their agents on the Continent are more propitious now
than ever, but many efforts are frustrated owing to the
sharp watch which is kept along the coast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They have tried eleven times to land since Saturday last,”
writes Cormier, “and failed every time. There were always either
people in sight or else there were transports sailing from Havre to
Dieppe or from Dieppe to Saint-Valery, etc., etc. There has been
a lot going on evidently, for signals have been given on fifteen or
twenty different occasions. That shows how important it is to
effect a landing. They returned simply to make this fact known to
me, and went back again without coming on shore—except the
captain, who came for an hour and who is positive they have something
to hand over to him. I believe this myself, for I learn also
this morning that the Government boat which plies along the coast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
of Brittany has made thirty vain attempts during the last three
weeks.”</p>
</div>

<p>We can imagine the mental condition of poor Lady
Atkyns on receiving letter after letter in this strain.
She no longer goes away from London at this period,
feeling too remote in the country from the centre of
news. She stays either at the Royal Hotel or else
with friends at 17, Park Lane. Here it is that she
receives Cormier, Frotté, Peltier. When there is a
long interval between their visits her fears grow apace.
What would she not give to take an active part herself
in the enterprise! “No messenger arrived—no news,
therefore, from France,” that is the message that comes
to her only too often. And Cormier writes, full of
excuses for his persistent appeals—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Forgive my tone,” he writes. “I apologize a thousand times for
being such a worry to you, but I can’t help it in regard to so
important a matter, calling for so much energy and hurry. You
have voluntarily abandoned the position ensured you by your sex
and great advantages in order to play the <i>rôle</i> of a great and
high-minded statesman. There are discomforts and disadvantages
attached to this new estate, and it is my misfortune to have to
bring this home to you. I can but console myself with the thought
of your goodness and of the great cause which we have embraced
and which is the subject of all our anxieties. May God prosper it,
and may it bring you glory and me happiness!”</p>
</div>

<p>In the mouth of any one but Cormier these protestations
would arouse one’s distrust; but what we already
know of him, and what we are to learn presently of his
later conduct, serve to reassure us in regard to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>In spite of all his good will, however, Cormier is
constantly being interrupted in his work. Now it is
the health of his son, Achille, which disquiets him, now
he is a prey to terrible attacks of gout which will give
him no rest.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been bent double for two nights and a day,” he writes
to his friend on September 1, 1794, “without being able to change
my position. It takes four persons to move this great body of
mine. I am a little more free from pain at present, and I take up
my pen at the earliest possible moment to send you this explanation
of my silence.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is at this moment that Louis de Frotté, who has
been a little in the background, comes again to the front
of the stage. Since his arrival in London, the young
officer, without neglecting the society of the Royalist
Committee, has been spending most of his time in the
offices of the English Government, endeavouring to impress
upon Windham “the desirability of carrying out
his ideas, and the ease with which they may be brought
to fruit, as he has made up his mind to devote himself
to them.” One project he has specially at heart, that of
receiving some kind of official mission from the Government
which will enable him to land in Normandy with
adequate powers and to give new life there to the
Royalist insurrection. Should he succeed, the help he
“would thus obtain would lead to the execution of our
cherished plans,” he writes to Lady Atkyns, and she
will reap at last “all the honour that will be due to the
generous sacrifices that she has made.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>But in his interview with the Minister he does not
think it necessary to speak of their relations with the
Temple. This secret is too important for him to
confide it to any one. “Too many people know it
already.” These words, hinting a delicate reproach, are
meant, perhaps, to put his fair friend upon her guard.
Perhaps they mean more than that. Read in the light
of subsequent letters from the young <i>émigré</i>, they serve
as a key to his private feelings—to his dislike at having
to share her confidence with so many others, and to his
jealousy later of the man who has so large a place in her
heart. These feelings, still slight, soon become more
marked, and presently we find that they are reciprocated.</p>

<p>For the time being, however, both Frotté and Cormier
worked with the same ardour at their allotted tasks.
Frotté, proceeding with his negotiation with Windham,
counted now upon support from Puisaye, his famous
compatriot recently come to England. Cormier writes
to her to report that, despite apparent dilatoriness, their
agents have not been inactive.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have received letters through the captain,” he tells her on
October 1, 1794, “which satisfy me, brief as they are. Here is
what they have to tell me: ‘Be at ease in your mind; they imagine
they are working for themselves, and really they are working for
us, and we shall have the profit. Be patient and don’t lose trust.’
The captain had orders to return at once to-day, but he will not
start until to-night or to-morrow morning, and we have news by
the packet-boats meanwhile that order reigns in Paris.”</p>
</div>

<p>Day after day passed by, bringing new reports, none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
of them positive, of the death of the little Dauphin.
Lady Atkyns knew not what to make of the situation.
Presently—eight days after the last—there came another
letter from Cormier, to reassure her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have great faith in your judgment,” he declares, “and your
presentiments are almost always right, but I really do not think
that you have ground for disquiet now. Three agents of ours at
the Temple are either at work silently or else they are in hiding.
All we know for certain is that they have not been guillotined, as
they have not been mentioned in any of the lists.”</p>
</div>

<p>His wife was still unfortunately detained, but there
was prospect of her being shortly at liberty, and then
she would write to him. If the agents had taken it
upon themselves to modify their project—the one
thing that was to be feared—they could not possibly
have succeeded in sending particulars yet of this.
But an explanation of the mystery was soon to be
forthcoming.</p>

<p>“The Dauphin is not to be got out by main force or
in a balloon,” Cormier had once written. Any attempt
at carrying him off under the very nose of his warders
and of the delegates of the Commune would have been
madness. All idea of such a rescue had long been put
aside. How, then, was the matter to be dealt with?
By such means as circumstances might dictate—by
finding a substitute for the young prisoner, a mute who
should play the <i>rôle</i> until an occasion should offer for
smuggling away the real Dauphin, concealed meanwhile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
somewhere in the upper chambers of the Tower. Mme.
Atkyns did not herself approve of this plan.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was strongly opposed to it,” she notes at the foot of a letter
from Cormier dated June 3, 1795, “as I pointed out to my friends
that it might have an undesirable result, and that those who were
being entrusted with the carrying off of the Dauphin, after getting
the money, might declare afterwards that he had not been got out
of the Temple.”</p>
</div>

<p>She saw reason to fear that at the last moment she
would be done out of the recompense of all her efforts,
and that the Royal child would not be entrusted to
her care.</p>

<p>However, it was clear that once the plan was agreed
upon it was necessary in order to carry it out to secure
the help of the gaoler Laurent, who had had the
Dauphin under his charge during the last four months.
Laurent’s complicity may be traced through the documents
bearing upon the whole episode.</p>

<p>Let us examine first of all Laurent’s own famous
letters, the first of which, dated November 7, 1794,
synchronizes with the events we have been following.</p>

<p>It is well known that only copies of these letters are
in existence—the originals have never been discovered.
They were published first in a book which appeared in
1835, <i>Le Véritable Duc de Normandie</i>, the work of an
adherent of the pretender, Nauendorff, Bourbon-Leblanc,
whose real name was Gabriel de Bourbon-Russet, dit
Leblanc. From the fact of the originals being missing,
the authenticity of these letters has long been a matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
for debate. A close examination of them, side by side
with all the other documents upon which we have come
in the course of our researches, results, we think, in
justifying our belief in their genuineness.</p>

<p>Cormier, then, was not mistaken in supposing that his
agents had modified their plan. The letter in which
he confided his suspicion to Lady Atkyns was dated
October 8, 1794. On the last day of the same month
he wrote to her again:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have to thank you cordially for your kind letter of yesterday.
I have had no time to answer it properly, not because of the gout,
for that has left me. In fact, my mind is so fully occupied that I
have no time to trouble about any kind of malady, and am, in fact,
at my wits’ end with excitement. However, I must just send you
this brief note in haste (for it is just post time) to bid you not
merely be at rest but to rejoice! <i>I am able to assure you positively
that the Master and his belongings are saved! There is no doubt about
it.</i> But say nothing of this, keep it absolutely secret, do not let it
be suspected even by your bearing. <i>Moreover, nothing will happen
to-day, or to-morrow, or the day after, nor for more than a month, but I
am quite sure of what I say, and I was never more at my ease in my own
mind.</i> I can give you no details now, and can only tell you all
when we meet; but you can share my feeling of security. I am
glad to say I have good news of my wife, but I must continue to
keep a sharp look out all round me.”</p>
</div>

<p>This letter evidently alludes to what had happened
at the Temple. The young Dauphin, we may conclude,
was halfway on his road to liberty. Lodged in the
garrets of the Temple tower, and with the little mute
as his substitute down below, he was not yet out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
peril. But an important step had been taken towards
the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>It seemed clear that Laurent, <i>l’homme de Barras</i>,
was having a share in this, and had at least rendered
possible the execution of the project. The letter which
he wrote eight days later to a general, whose identity
has never been established, bore out exactly what
Cormier had said; here it is:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“General,<br>
</p>

<p>“Your letter of the 6th came too late, for your first plan
had been carried out already—there was no time to lose. To-morrow
a new warder is to enter upon his duties—a Republican
named Gommier, a good fellow from what B—— tells me, but I
have no confidence in such people. I shall find it very difficult to
convey food to our P——. But I shall take care of him; you need
not be anxious. The assassins have been duped, and the new
municipal people have no idea that the little mute has been substituted
for the Dauphin. The thing to be done now is to get him
out of this cursed tower—but how? B—— tells me he cannot do
anything on account of the way he is watched. If there were to be
a long delay I should be uneasy about his health, for there is not
much air in his <i>oubliette</i>—the <i>bon Dieu</i> would not find him there if
he were not almighty! He has promised me to die rather than
betray himself, and I have reason to believe that he would. His
sister knows nothing; I thought it prudent to pass the little mute
off on her as her real brother. Meanwhile, this poor little fellow
seems quite happy, and plays his part so well, all unconsciously, that
the new guard is convinced that he is merely refusing to speak. So
there is no danger. Please send back our faithful messenger to me,
as I have need of your help. Follow the advice he will convey to
you orally, for that is the only way to our success.</p>

<p>“The Temple Tower, November 7, 1794.”</p>
</div>

<p>The contents of this letter, taken together with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
date, accord in a remarkable way with Cormier’s communication
to Lady Atkyns.</p>

<p>There is another striking argument in favour of the
authenticity of Laurent’s letters. When they were
produced by the pretender Nauendorff, they were for
the most part in complete contradiction to all that was
known of the Dauphin’s captivity and the testimonies
of those connected with it. Certain facts to which they
made allusion were known to nobody. Thus Laurent
states clearly on November 7 that a new warder—whom
he calls Gommier instead of Gomin—is to come to the
Temple next day and to be associated with him. Now,
in 1835, when this letter was published, what was
known of Gomin? Next to nothing, and the little that
was known did not tally with Laurent’s statements.
Simeon Despreaux, author of a book entitled “Louis
XVIII.,” published in 1817, did not even know of
Gomin’s existence. Gomin himself made a formal
declaration before the magistrates that he entered the
Temple about July 27, 1794, before Laurent was there
at all. Many years later it was found, on examining
all the documents referring to the Temple that were
kept in the National Archives, that Laurent’s statements
were quite correct.</p>

<p>Some days after this letter to Lady Atkyns, Cormier
informed Frotté of the great news, in the course of a
visit paid him by the latter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know all about it,” he said, according to Frotté’s account of
the interview afterwards in a letter to Lady Atkyns, “because they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
could do nothing without me; but everything is now ready, and I
give you my word that the King and France are saved. All the
necessary steps have been taken. I can tell you no more.... Do
not question me, don’t try to go further into the matter. Already
I have told you more than I had any right to, and from Mr. Pitt
down to myself there is now no one who knows more about it than
you do. So I beg of you to keep it absolutely to yourself.”</p>
</div>

<p>From November 8, then, Laurent is no longer sole
guardian of the young Prince. His duties are henceforth
shared with Gomin. What kind of relations
subsisted between the two? It is hard to say, for
it is even more difficult to find out the truth about the
Temple during the subsequent months than during
those which went before.</p>

<p>We find one innovation introduced during these
months which is worth noting. It is no longer the
delegates of the Commune who have to pay the daily
visit to the prison, but the representatives of the
<i>Comités Civils</i> of the forty-eight divisions of Paris.
Now, among all those who visited the Dauphin none
left any record, with one exception, to which we shall
come presently. All that we can learn from Gomin’s
own statements, so often contradictory, is that throughout
the period the child placed under his care uttered
no word. The warder takes no further notice of this
strange conduct, Laurent having satisfied him that
if the Dauphin will not open his mouth it is because
of the infamous deposition against his mother that he
was made to sign. It is unnecessary to point out
how improbable was this explanation, the Dauphin’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
examination having taken place on October 6, 1793, and
Laurent not having come to the Temple until July 29,
1794. Gomin, however, asked no further questions,
and Laurent experiencing no further anxiety in regard
to him, sought what means he could of bringing about
the desired end.</p>

<p>Six weeks pass, however, without further progress,
and then on November 5 Laurent hears, to his great
satisfaction, that his master has become a member of
the Committee of Public Safety. This new office would
surely enable the general to carry out his plan and
relieve the anxious guardian from the heavy responsibility
lying on his shoulders.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, not without surprise that on
December 19 Laurent and Gomin saw three Commissioners
of the Committee of Public Safety make
their way into the prison and up the stairway of the
Tower to the Dauphin’s cell. These three visitors—Harmand
la Meuse, Matthieu, and Reverchon—asked
to see the Dauphin, so that they might question him
and satisfy themselves as to the way in which he was
kept under supervision. At a time when there were so
many rumours current about the Temple, and when
rescues were openly talked about, when every day
brought forth some new sensational report, it was only
natural that the Convention, in order to silence these
rumours and calm public opinion, should institute an
official inspection of the prison in this way.</p>

<p>In a work which he published twenty years later,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
Harmand de la Meuse tells us all that we know of this
visit, and of the impression made upon the delegates by
the little mute ushered into their presence. Suffice it
here to record that this narrative (written with an
eye to the good graces of Louis XVIII.) makes it quite
clear that it was a mute whom they saw, and that all
efforts to extract replies were quite in vain.</p>

<p>Harmand repeats the explanation of this persistent
silence which had been furnished by Laurent. He
ignores the fact that the Dauphin had talked with the
Simons, had been interviewed by Barras, and had
been heard to speak on several other occasions.</p>

<p>Assuredly, Harmand and his colleagues—his narrative
allows it to be seen on every page—very soon realized
that they were not in the presence of the Dauphin.
This is proved by the fact that, despite the very distinct
terms of the resolution of the Committee entrusting
them with this mission, and the object of which was
to dispel the rumours current in Paris, “they decided
they would make no public report, but would confine
themselves to a secret record of their experience to the
Committee itself.”</p>

<p>However natural and intelligible all this may have
been to those who knew what was in the mind of the
Convention and the exigencies of the situation at this
period, to Laurent it was a matter of stupefaction.
Barras had sent him no warning, and his position was
getting more and more difficult, for his colleague, who
had, of course, to be taken into his confidence, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
beginning to be nervous about participating any further
in the intrigue, and might betray him any day. At
last he loses patience, and expresses himself as follows
to his friend the unknown general:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have just received your letter. Alas, your request is impossible.
It was easy enough to get the ‘victim’ upstairs, but to get him
down again is for the moment impossible, for so sharp a watch is
being kept and I am afraid of being betrayed. The Committee of
Public Safety sent those monsters Matthieu and Reverchon, as you
know, to establish the fact that our mute is really the son of
Louis XVI. General, what does it all mean? I don’t know what
to make of B——’s conduct. He talks now of getting rid of our
mute and replacing him by another boy who is ill. Were you
aware of this? Is it not a trap of some kind. I am getting very
much alarmed, for great care is being taken not to let any one into
the prison of our mute, lest the substitution should become known,
for if any one examined him they would discover that he was deaf
from birth, and in consequence naturally mute. But to substitute
some one else for him! The new substitute will talk, and will do
both for our half-rescued P—— and for myself with him. Please
send back our messenger at once with your written reply.</p>

<p>“The Temple Tower, February 5, 1795.”</p>
</div>

<p>Let us note the date of this letter—February 5.
Therefore the visit referred to must have taken place
before February 5. Now, Eckard, one of the earliest
biographers of the Dauphin, having in the first edition
of his book made the date December 2, 1794, altered
it afterwards to February 13, 1795. De Beauchesne
makes it February 27. Chantelauze, February 26.</p>

<p>On referring to the original documents at our disposal,
however, we find that Laurent’s letter is borne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
out. In his book, <i>Le dernier roi legitime de France</i>,
M. Provins shows that the visit must have taken place
between November 5, 1794, and January 4, 1795, as it
was only during this period that the three delegates were
all members of the Committee. A recent discovery of
documents in the National Archives establishes the fact
that it took place on December 19, 1794.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br><span class="small">THE MYSTERY OF THE TEMPLE (<i>continued</i>)</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Meanwhile the feelings of jealousy and suspicion
which had sprung up between Cormier, still Lady
Atkyns’s principal lieutenant and confidant, and the
Chevalier de Frotté were becoming more and more
marked. At the beginning of October, 1794, Cormier
learns of a correspondence in progress between Lady
Atkyns and a person whom he imagines to be his rival
(but who turns out to be merely the “little baron”), and
his ill-humour breaks out in the form of reproaches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Chance has willed that I should become acquainted with the
fact that some one has been getting up a correspondence with you,”
he writes to Lady Atkyns, “in such a way as to prevent me from
hearing of it.... You will admit that I am justified in assuming
there are reasons why this correspondence is being kept secret
from me.”</p>
</div>

<p>But he proceeds to assure Lady Atkyns that she still
retains all his admiration and respect, and to protest
that he only acquaints her with the discovery that he
has made because of his attachment to her. Filled
with mistrust of Frotté, Cormier withholds from him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
particulars as to the progress of affairs at the Temple,
and only vouchsafes his information now and again in
vague terms. “I refused to give Frotté the names of
the agents,” he wrote to Lady Atkyns some months
later. “Please remember that. I shall always be
proud of that.”</p>

<p>It is not astonishing that Frotté should show some
surprise at the way in which he was being treated,
though he was prevented by other causes of annoyance—his
failure to get any satisfaction out of the British
Government and the repeated postponements of his
departure—from taking his position in this respect too
much to heart.</p>

<p>Lady Atkyns herself was keeping him at a distance at
this time and avoiding him when she came to London.
When he asks for an interview, she refuses on the
pretext of her widowed state and public opinion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wished to avoid seeing or writing M. de Frotté,” she herself
records at a later period, “as I was not in a position to talk to him
about the means being taken for the rescue of the King.”</p>
</div>

<p>However, on the eve of setting out from England
into the unknown, the Chevalier makes one more effort
to see her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You do not write to me,” he begins his letter (December 27,
1794), “and I should be angry with you if I could be angry with
any one, now that I have all my wishes fulfilled. In three days
everything has changed, and I have nothing more to ask for in
England. The longed-for moment has come. P[uisaye] wants me.
I go with him, and all my requests are granted. We start on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
Thursday at latest. It is important that I should see you. I beg
of you to set out at once and spend twenty-four hours here, but
without any one knowing of your journey, lest its object should be
suspected. Try to be here by Monday evening, and let me know
where I could see you.”</p>
</div>

<p>This time the appeal was too strong to be resisted.
It was in the depths of winter, and the letter arrived at
Ketteringham in the evening; but Lady Atkyns hired
a post-chaise at once, and set out a few hours later,
and travelled all night in stormy weather to London,
arriving there in the morning. She seems, however, to
have resisted the temptation to let Frotté into the secret
of the Temple doings. Perhaps she had a presentiment
that the Chevalier, for all his protestations of fidelity
now, would fall away later and pass into the camp of
some other pretendant to the throne.</p>

<p>We have spoken already of the endless intrigues
which were being hatched round the British Government
by the hordes of <i>émigrés</i> and broken-down exiles
from the Continent. For these gentry, mostly penniless
and forced to beg their livelihood, no resource was too
base by which they could get into favour with the
Ministers. Besides scheming in a thousand different
fashions against the common enemy, the Revolution,
they stuck at nothing in their efforts to throw suspicion
upon each other. The little court which had gathered
round the Comte D’Artois on the Continent was also a
hotbed of plots and schemes, the influence of which made
itself felt in London. Every one spied on every one else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>In the midst of this world of intruders a sort of
industrial association came into being in the course of
the year 1794, for the purpose of inundating France
with false paper-money. It was hoped that in this
way a severe blow would be dealt at the hated Jacobins
and their friends. These nefarious proceedings soon
became known, and called forth the indignation of some
of the better class of <i>émigrés</i>, among them the honest
Cormier.</p>

<p>His position among his compatriots was not at this
time of the best. They had no love for this man of
firm character, faithful to his principles and incapable
of lending his countenance to such doings. He himself
soon came to realize this.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One doesn’t know whom to trust,” he wrote to Lady Atkyns.
“I am sure some one has furnished the Government with a long
report upon my projects. I am on the track of the man who
I think is guilty. There is no reason for you to be anxious on the
subject. I shall soon know what has been done, and both the
traitor and the Government shall be outwitted.”</p>
</div>

<p>About this time a flood of memorials of all sorts
poured in by mysterious channels upon the British
Government, maintaining that “the general desire of
the French was for a change in the ruling family.”
Cormier discovered that they all were traceable to the
same source, and we find him declaring energetically
that “the blasphemous scoundrels” who were responsible
for them all belonged to one clique.</p>

<p>His indignation, in which he found few sympathizers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
made him a number of enemies, and the disfavour with
which he was already regarded in French circles soon
changed into downright hatred. The fact that he
denounced the false paper-money to the British Government—and
not in vain—was a cause of special bitterness
against him. By way of revenge, they could think of
nothing better than to accuse him of being himself
guilty of the very offences against which he had set
his face.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They are trying to make out that I am the owner of ships
which I use for the purpose of conveying this false paper-money
to Brittany,” he writes to Lady Atkyns. “They have stated this
to the Government. Fortunately, my whole conduct and reputation,
and all that I have done to destroy this shameful traffic, serve to
show the improbability of such accusations.”</p>
</div>

<p>But, in spite of all his energy and determination,
Cormier’s enemies were too strong for him. It was in
vain that he demonstrated his good faith. Calumny
had done its work.</p>

<p>The British Government had decided, in concert with
the Comte d’Artois, to send an important mission to the
Netherlands, with a view, doubtless, to establishing
relations with the Stadtholder, whose position was
becoming critical owing to the sequel to the Revolution.
The man to be entrusted with this mission would have
to be some one who had given proof of his qualifications.
Cormier seemed cut out for the post, and he stood in
readiness for it, enjoying the prospect of thus getting
into touch again with France, and of perhaps being able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
to serve the interests that were so dear to him. But he
had reckoned without his foes. Their efforts were
redoubled, and in the course of November Cormier
learnt that another had been entrusted with the mission.
His anger and disappointment can be imagined. He
decided that, in spite of all, he would leave England
and betake himself to Holland on private business.
Doubtless he imagined also that it would be an advantage
to be near the French frontier, and that he would
be the better able to follow the course of events at the
Temple. It was a risky step to take, for there was
nothing to guarantee his complete security in the
Netherlands.</p>

<p>However that might be, his decision was taken, and
on November 25, 1794, Baron d’Auerweck wrote to
Lady Atkyns to acquaint her with the news of
Cormier’s departure, conveying to her at the same
time many apologies for his having himself neglected
to write to her to take farewell. During the months
that follow the “little baron” replaces the Breton
magistrate as principal correspondent of Lady Atkyns.</p>

<p>It is a strange personality that stands revealed in
these letters of Baron d’Auerweck. Keen and resourceful,
the baron lays himself out to exploit to the utmost
the valuable friendship of the English lady, thus bequeathed
to him, as it were, by Cormier. Trained by
Peltier, d’Auerweck seems to have modelled himself
upon his master, and to have become in his turn the
accomplished publicist, plausible, fluent, supple, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
gift of raillery and sarcasm, together with a turn for
philosophy. Lady Atkyns, though not unappreciative
of his copious epistles, shows clearly that she estimates
him at his real value, and is careful not to take him too
much into her confidence. It must be enough for him
to know that there is still reason to hope that the
Dauphin may be saved. D’Auerweck himself is not in
a position to give her much information in return. His
letters consist rather of a bright and lively commentary
upon the political situation and the course of events
generally in France.</p>

<p>Upon Cormier’s decision to leave England the Baron
expresses himself in downright language, and makes it
a text for a disquisition upon his elder’s character.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cormier’s departure has disturbed me a good deal,” he writes to
Lady Atkyns, “the more so that, with a little prudence, he could
have spared himself this unpleasantness, and might have succeeded
in getting what he wanted. A man who has passed his whole life
in the magistracy ought, at the age of fifty-six, to know something
about men, but Cormier has never got further than the A B C of
such knowledge. I have had some rather hot disputes with him
over his rash confidence, his purposeless explosions, his sudden
friendships that ended in ruptures, thus increasing the number of
his enemies.... But we both of us felt the parting. I must do
him the justice of admitting that there is a lot of kindness and
sympathy in his character. I think he has the same feeling of
friendship for me that I have for him. It is my wish to serve him
whenever the opportunity may arrive.”</p>
</div>

<p>By an unfortunate coincidence, the political situation
in Holland was undergoing a disquieting change at the
moment of Cormier’s arrival. Until then England had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
exercised a decisive influence there, both by reason of
the presence of her army and through counsels of the
Stadtholder. But in the autumn of 1794 a popular
feeling in favour of the Revolution began to make itself
felt, fanned by the hostility aroused against the undisciplined
English troops, with their looting and
pillaging, and intensified by an unlooked-for piece of
news: the French, led by Pichegru, had crossed the
frontier and were advancing by long marches, and
seizing all the places they passed through on their way.
In a few weeks the power of the Stadtholder would
have gone! Though clothed in rags, the soldiers of the
National Convention were welcomed with transports of
delight. Never did troops show such discipline, it
should be added.</p>

<p>But Pichegru was not alone. Beside him marched
representatives of the Convention, eager to institute in
the United Provinces the principles of the Revolution
and to establish the guarantees of order and security
inseparable therefrom.</p>

<p>Therein lay the danger for those who, like Cormier,
were to be found in <i>flagrante delicto</i> of emigration. On
November 8, 1794, an order came from the Committee
of Public Safety to the representatives with the army,
commanding them to seize the Stadtholder, together
with his wife and children, as well as to arrest immediately
all <i>émigrés</i> who might fall into their hands.</p>

<p>Knowledge of this important decree had not come to
London on December 15, for on this date we find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
d’Auerweck writing to Lady Atkyns that he has had
news of Cormier, “who is now at La Haye in good
health and spirits.”</p>

<p>The extreme cold which prevailed this year contributed
in a remarkable degree, as is well known, to
the success of Pichegru’s operations in Holland. Shut
in by the ice, the powerless fleet was obliged to surrender
to the French cavalry—a memorable incident in the
military annals of the Republic. The famous dams,
which were to be opened and to flood the country
and submerge the French, became useless by reason
of the frost. In short, Pichegru triumphed throughout.
He made his entry into Amsterdam on January 10,
1795, and eight days later the Stadtholder embarked
for England. The Dutch Republic had come into being.</p>

<p>Cormier’s fate throughout this period must have been
a matter for anxiety to Lady Atkyns, but the absence
of anything in the shape of definite news from Paris as
to the state of things at the Temple continued to be to
her a source of far greater disquietude. The vague
assurance as to the Dauphin’s well-being, which d’Auerweck
transmitted to her from time to time, counted for
nothing, as she knew herself to be better informed as
to what had been under way.</p>

<p>What had been happening? A third letter, addressed
by Laurent to his correspondent, under date of March 3,
1795, enlightens us a little:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our little mute has now been smuggled away into the palace
of the Temple and well concealed. There he will remain, and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
need be can be passed off as the Dauphin. The triumph is
altogether yours, general. You can now be quite at ease in your
mind—send me your orders and I shall carry them out. Lasne
will take my place now as soon as he likes. The best and safest
steps have been taken to ensure the Dauphin’s safety. Consequently
I shall be able to get to you in a few days, and shall be able to tell
you all further details orally.”</p>
</div>

<p>These lines herald a momentous alteration in the
<i>régime</i> of the prison. First of all, there is the question
of Laurent’s leaving it. Presumably his presence is no
longer needed there. This suggests that success is
assured. And Lasne—how is it that his name makes
its appearance here for the first time? We shall find
him declaring in 1834 that his service in the Temple
began in Fructidor year II., that is to say, between
August 18 and September 16, 1794.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> In that case
Laurent would have had him as his colleague for several
months already! The Temple documents preserved in
the National Archives, and examined fifteen years later,
establish the fact that Lasne did not, indeed, enter
upon his duties until March 31, 1795, thus bearing out
the accuracy of Laurent’s statement.</p>

<p>We see, then, that the little mute has been transferred
to the palace of the Temple—that is to say, into
one of the many empty suites in the great maze of
buildings that surrounded the Tower. Here he has
been, or perhaps will soon be, joined by the Dauphin
himself, for means of retreat from this labyrinth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
buildings are infinitely greater than from the fourth
storey of the Tower.</p>

<p>To replace the mute, another substitute has been
found, a scrofulous boy who may be expected soon to
die. All barriers to the Dauphin’s escape will thus be
removed. So much we gather from Laurent, and all his
statements are borne out by documents which have been
left by Royalist agents.</p>

<p>This second substitution effected, Laurent was able
to quit his post with an easy mind, and we find that he
did actually leave the Temple on March 29, 1795. His
successor, Lasne, arrives two days later. Gomin, who
perhaps knows part of the truth through Laurent (and,
moreover, his <i>rôle</i> is more especially to attend to Marie
Thérèse), is careful not to confide in him, knowing well
the risk he would run by so doing. Lasne finds in the
prison a boy who is evidently very ill, in great suffering,
whose death is soon to be expected. What would be
the use of asking questions? It is enough for him to
attend to the child as best he may during the few
weeks of life that still remain to him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Spring had passed and June had arrived before Lady
Atkyns was again to see the familiar handwriting,
rounded and minute, of her friend the Breton magistrate.
The letter bore the postmark of Hamburg. What
was Cormier doing on the banks of the Elbe? He would
seem to have had some perilous adventures. Probably
he had been arrested as an <i>émigré</i> and had escaped the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
guillotine by some happy chance. However that may
be, the news he had to tell of events in France came as
a great relief to his correspondent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have been better served, my dear friend, than we ourselves
arranged. Our agents have not kept to our plan, but they have
done wisely.... But we must have patience. Things are in such a
condition at present that they can be neither hastened nor delayed.
A false move might have very bad results.”</p>
</div>

<p>Within a week of the arrival of this letter, an
announcement, that came to many as a surprise, found
its way round London. It was officially reported that
the Dauphin had died in prison on June 8, 1795. Had
not Cormier’s assurances come in time to buoy her up,
so categorical a statement might well have given Lady
Atkyns a severe shock. She knew now, however, that
it could not be of <i>her</i> boy that there was question.</p>

<p>Some weeks pass in silence, and Lady Atkyns,
impatient for news, urges the “little baron” to set out
for Hamburg. He starts in the first week of July, but
is delayed at Ocfordnese, whence he writes to her on
the 16th. At last he reaches his destination, but means
of communication are so uncertain that several more
weeks elapse before she hears anything further. September
finds d’Auerweck returning to London with a
letter from Cormier to Lady Atkyns. In October,
again unable to curb her anxiety, she had just decided
to send d’Auerweck to Paris, when, to her deep grief
and dismay, she learnt suddenly from Cormier that
everything had gone wrong—that “they had all been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
deceived, shamefully deceived.” The child that had died
on June 8 was, indeed, the second substitute, and the
Dauphin had undoubtedly escaped, but others had got
possession of him, and the boy handed over to Lady
Atkyns’ agents was the young mute.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Yes,” he writes, “we have been taken in totally and completely.
That is quite certain. But how have they managed to do it? And
did we take every step that could be taken to make this impossible?
These are matters you will want me to go into in detail, and I shall
not fail to do so; but I must wait until I have time to trace the
sequence of events from a diary day by day for a year past. The
entries for the first two months are missing for the present—the
least interesting period certainly, since down to that time, and
for several months afterwards, only the project of carrying off the
Dauphin was being kept in view, the project which had to be
abandoned afterwards in favour of another which seemed simpler
and more feasible, as well as less perilous.”</p>
</div>

<p>Cormier’s long letter left Lady Atkyns completely in
the dark as to what exactly had happened. They had
been tricked somehow—that was all she knew.</p>

<p>To us, as to her, the names of most of the many
participants in this mysterious intrigue remain unknown.
Laurent went off to San Domingo in the following year,
where he died on August 22, 1807. Gomin, to some
extent his accomplice in the matter of the substitution,
followed Marie Antoinette’s daughter to Austria, and
was careful to keep what he knew to himself. As for
our three friends, Cormier, Frotté, and d’Auerweck, we
shall learn presently the reasons for their silence.</p>

<p>The one person who has tried to clear up the obscurity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
of these happenings inside the Temple is the wife of the
bootmaker, Antoine Simon, the Dauphin’s first warder.
Considerations of space prevent us from entering here
upon any detailed examination of her evidence, but we
must not pass it by without a word. Mme. Simon,
after her husband’s death during the Reign of Terror—he
was guillotined in Thermidor—withdrew to the
asylum for incurables in the Rue de Sèvres, where she
was to spend the remainder of her existence. Here she
was heard on many occasions to assert that she was
convinced the Dauphin was alive, having seen him
carried off when she and her husband were leaving the
Temple, on the evening of January 19, 1794. If this
were true, it would result that that child looked after
by Laurent was not the Dauphin at all! This does not
fit in with the version that we have put together from
Laurent’s own letters and the various other documents
which we have been able to examine. But even if it
were true, the poignant question would still call for an
answer—what became of the young Dauphin after his
escape? Into whose hands did he fall?</p>

</div>



<p>What was the Chevalier de Frotté doing all this
time? What steps was he taking towards the realization
of what he had called so often the goal of his life,
and towards the execution of the promises he had made
with so much ardour and enthusiasm?</p>

<p>Transported with joy on hearing that the British
Government at last contemplated listening to his projects
and sending him to Normandy, Frotté, when
leaving London, betook himself with four comrades-in-arms
to Jersey—the great <i>rendezvous</i> at that time for
the insurgents engaged in dangerous enterprises on the
Continent, and seeking to find landing-places on the
French coast.</p>

<p>It was the middle of winter—snow was falling
heavily, and there were strong winds. Several weeks
passed, during which the patience of our <i>émigrés</i> was
severely taxed. Nothing was more difficult than to
effect a landing in Normandy under such conditions.
Apart from the difficulty of finding a vessel to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
the crossing, it was necessary to choose some spot
where they might succeed in escaping the vigilance of
the troops stationed all along the cliffs, whose forts
presented a formidable barrier. In short, Frotté and
his friends found themselves confronted with serious
obstacles.</p>

<p>On January 11, 1795, they were observed to leave
Guernsey in a small sailing-vessel manned by English
sailors, taking with them three <i>émigrés</i> who were to act
as guides. What happened to them? No one knows
exactly. Certain it is merely that the boat returned
rudderless and disabled, with Frotté and his four companions.
According to their own account, they took a
wrong direction in the dark, and sailed along the coast
in the midst of rocks. Their guides landed first, and
disappeared from sight under a hail of bullets, and it
was with great difficulty that they themselves had been
able to get back to Guernsey.</p>

<p>At the beginning of February they made another
effort, and succeeded in landing near Saint-Brieuc.
Frotté at once made his way inland to join the insurgents,
but ill fortune followed him. He had not
been a fortnight in the country when he learned, to his
surprise, that the Chouans under Cormatin had just
concluded a truce to prepare the way for peace. His
feelings may be imagined. To have waited so long for
this! So much for his hopes and castles in the air!
But there was no help for it. On February 17, 1795,
the treaty of Tannaye was concluded, and a month<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
later Frotté, who had kept moving about over La
Vendée and Normandy unceasingly to survey the
ground, established himself at Rennes, where he assisted
at the conference of La Mabilais, which was to confirm
the truce already agreed to.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp62" id="004" style="max-width: 52.125em;">

<p class="center">(<i>After a portrait belonging to the Marquis de Frotté.</i>)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If the turn taken by events had led him off temporarily
in a different direction, his mind never abandoned
the secret purpose which had brought him to France.
Nevertheless, a change, at first imperceptible, but afterwards
obvious enough, was coming over him.</p>

<p>The reader will not have forgotten the way in which
a feeling of antagonism had grown up between Cormier
and the Chevalier. The ill-will cherished by the latter
for his quondam friend had not disappeared. On the
contrary, the belief that Lady Atkyns was keeping him
deliberately at arm’s length had intensified the jealousy.
The result was inevitable. Chagrined at being thus left
on one side, and at being supplanted, as he felt, in his
fair lady’s affections, he soon began to devote himself
entirely to his new <i>rôle</i> as a Chouan leader, and ceased
to interest himself any longer in the drama of the
Temple. In truth, he was not without pretexts for this
semi-desertion of the cause.</p>

<p>On March 16, anxious to explain himself to Lady
Atkyns, he writes to tell her just how he is feeling on
the subject. He would have her realize that there is no
longer any ground for hopes as to the Dauphin’s safety.
When in touch with the representatives of the Convention
who took part in the conference at La Mabilais, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
had taken one of them aside, it seems, and questioned
him frankly as to whether the Republican Government
would consent to listen to any proposal regarding the
young Prince, and whether he, Frotté, would be allowed
to write to the Temple. The member of the Convention
made reply, after taking a day to consider the matter
and to consult his colleagues, that what Frotté suggested
was out of the question.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your devotion,” he said, “would be fruitless, for under Robespierre
the unhappy boy was so demoralized, mentally and physically,
that he is now almost an imbecile, and can’t live much longer.
Therefore you may as well dismiss any such idea from your head—you
can form no notion of the hopeless condition the poor little
creature has sunk into.”</p>
</div>

<p>These lines, reflecting the view then current among
the official representatives of the Convention, stand out
strikingly when we recall the situation at the Temple
in this very month of March, 1795, and the absolute
order given to Frotté not to allow the child to be seen.
They tally at all points with what we know of the
substitution that had been effected. To this substitution,
indeed, Frotté himself proceeds to make an explicit
allusion towards the end of the letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Perhaps the Convention is anxious,” he writes, “to bring about
the death of the child whom they have substituted for the young
King, so that they may be able to make people believe that the
latter is not really the King at all.”</p>
</div>

<p>As for himself, he has made up his mind. He will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
make no further efforts for the deliverance of the
Dauphin.</p>

<p>On April 25, 1795, the La Mabilais Treaty was
signed, and Frotté, who refused to subscribe to it, went
off again to Normandy, confident of seeing the struggle
recommence, and impatient to set going a new insurrection.
Had he received any reply from Lady Atkyns
to his outspoken missive? Assuredly not. If she gave
any credence to his statements at the time, they must
soon have passed out of her memory, for, thanks to
Cormier, June found her quite confident again of the
success of their plans. Not knowing, therefore, what
to say to her old admirer—Cormier having forbidden
her to tell him the names of their agents—she determined
to keep silent.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, on the day after June 8, the
report of the Dauphin’s death reached Normandy. The
proclamation of the Comte de Provence—for how many
weeks must he not have been waiting impatiently for it
to be made—as successor to the throne of France in his
nephew’s place was read to the insurgents. Frotté,
who for some time already had been responding to the
advances made to him by the pretendant, now formally
placed his sword at the service of the new King.</p>

<p>What would have prevented him from taking this
step? Would a personal interview with Lady Atkyns
have had this effect? Perhaps; but devoted now to his
new mission, passing from fight to fight, Frotté was no
longer his own master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, at the end of 1795, some feeling of
remorse, or else the desire to renew his old place in the
goodwill of Lady Atkyns, who had twice asked him to
write and tell her about himself, moved Frotté to take
pen in hand once again. He had been engaged in fighting
for several months, concerting surprises and ambuscades,
always on the <i>qui vive</i>. He had twice narrowly escaped
capture by the enemy. In spite of this he managed to
keep up an interesting correspondence with his companions
operating more to the south and to the west,
in La Vendée and in Le Bocage, and with the chiefs of
his party in London, who supplied the sinews of war, as
well as with Louis XVIII. himself, in whose cause he
had sworn to shed the last drop of his blood. There
is no reason to be astonished at finding our “Général
des Chouans” expressing himself thus, or at the changed
attitude adopted by him, dictated by circumstances and
the new situation in which he has now found himself.
Here is how he seeks to disabuse Lady Atkyns of the
hope to which she is still clinging:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No, dear lady, I shall not forget my devotion to you before I
forget my allegiance to the blood of my kings. I have broken faith
in no way, but, unfortunately, I have none but untoward news to
give you. I have been grieved to find that we have been deceived
most completely. For nearly a month after landing I was in the
dark, but at last I got to the bottom of the affair. I was not able
to get to see the unfortunate child who was born to rule over us.
He was not saved. The regicides—regicides twice over—having
first, like the monsters they are, allowed him to languish in his
prison, brought about his end there. He never left it. Just reflect
how we have all been duped. I don’t know how it is that without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
having ever received my letters you are still labouring under this
delusion. Nothing remains for you but to weep for our treasure
and to punish the miscreants who are responsible for his death.
Madame alone remains, and it is almost certain that she will be sent
to the Emperor, if this has not been done already.”</p>
</div>

<p>These lines but confirmed what Frotté had written
in the preceding March, after his talk with the representative
of the Convention. The news of the Dauphin’s
death having been proclaimed shortly after that, there
had been no longer any difficulty in persuading the
Chevalier to take up arms in the service of the Comte
de Provence. He discloses himself the change that has
come over his sentiments.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How is it,” he writes to Lady Atkyns, “that you are still under
the delusion, when all France has resounded with the story of the
misfortunes of our young, unhappy King? The whole of Europe
has now recognized His Royal Highness, his uncle, as King of
France.... The rights of blood have given me another master,
and I owe him equally my zeal and the service of my arm, happy in
having got a number of gallant Royalists together. I have the
honour of being in command of those fighting in Normandy. That
is my position, madame. You will readily understand how I have
suffered over the terrible destiny of my young King, and nothing
intensifies my sorrow so much as the thought of the sadness you
yourself will feel when you learn the truth. But moderate your
grief, my friend. You owe yourself to the sister not less than to
the brother.”</p>
</div>

<p>And to enforce this advice, Frotté recalls to her the
memory of the Queen, which should serve, he thinks, to
remove all scruples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Remember the commands of your august friend, and you will be
able to bear up under your misfortunes. You will keep up your
spirits for the sake of Madame. You will live for her and for your
friends, to whom, moreover, you should do more justice. Adieu,
my unhappy friend. Accept the homage of a true Royalist, who
will never cease to be devoted to you, who will never cease either to
deplore this deception of which we have been victims. Adieu.”</p>
</div>

<p>Was this farewell, taken in so nonchalant a fashion,
to denote a final sundering of two hearts united by so
many memories in common? It would appear so.
Lady Atkyns was so strong in her convictions that the
only effect of such words would be to make her feel
that all was over between her and the Chevalier.
Later, when he made an effort to renew relations with
her and asked her to return the letters he had written
to her, she would seem to have refused point blank,
from what she wrote to a confidant.</p>

<p>He must, however, have got hold of some portion of
their correspondence, for on his return to his château of
Couterne, this indefatigable penman, in the scant leisure
left him by his military duties, filled several note-books
with reminiscences and political reflections tending to
justify his conduct. In one of these note-books, which
have been carefully preserved, he transcribed fragments
of his letters to his friend—fragments carefully selected
in such a way as not to implicate him in the affair of
the Temple, once the death of the Dauphin had been
announced. Had he lived, he would doubtless have
learned what had really happened, as set forth in the
documents we have been studying; but his days were
numbered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>His end is well known: how, having fallen into an
ambush, he and six of his companions were shot by
Napoleon’s orders, in despite of a safe-conduct with
which he was furnished, on February 18, 1800, at
Verneuil. If in the course of these five years he did
learn the full truth about the Dauphin, he doubtless
abstained from any reference to it out of regard for the
King. He carried his private convictions in silence to
the grave.</p>

<p>The news of his death was received with emotion in
London. Peltier, who had had good opportunities for
forming an opinion of him, gave out a cry of horror.
“This act,” he wrote in his gazette, “covers Bonaparte
for ever with shame and infamy.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The small circle of Lady Atkyns’ London friends lost
thus one of its members. Meanwhile, Lady Atkyns
had been making the acquaintance of a French woman
who had been living in England for some years, and
whose feelings corresponded to a remarkable degree
with her own. This lady had found a warm welcome
at Richmond, near London, on her arrival as an <i>émigré</i>
from France.</p>

<p>Pale, thin, anxious-looking, the victim of a sombre
sorrow which almost disfigured her face, Louise de
Chatillon, Princesse de Tarente, wife of the Duc de la
Tremoïlle, had escaped death in a marvellous way. A
follower of Marie-Antoinette, from whom she had
been separated only by force, she had been arrested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
on the day after August 10 as having been the
friend of the Princesse de Lamballe. Shut up in
the sinister prison of l’Abbaye, she had felt that death
was close at hand. From her dungeon she could see
the men of September at their work and hear the cries
of agony given forth by their victims. At last, after
ten days of imprisonment, she was liberated, thanks to
an unexpected intervention, and in the month of
September, 1792, she succeeded in finding a ship to
take her to England.</p>

<p>Hers was a strikingly original personality, and it is
not without a feeling of surprise that one studies the
portrait of her which accompanies the recent work,
<i>Souvenirs de la Princesse de Tarente</i>. The drama
in which she had taken part, and the bloody spectacle
of which she had been a witness, seem to have left their
mark on her countenance, with its aspect of embittered
sadness. Her eyes give out a look of fierceness. Save
for the thin hair partially covering her forehead, there
is almost nothing feminine in her face. Seeing her for
the first time, Lady Atkyns must have received an
impression for which she was unprepared. They took
to each other, however, very quickly, having a bond
in common in their memories of the Queen. Both
had come under the charm of Marie-Antoinette, their
devotion to whom was ardent and sincere. The Queen
was their one great topic of conversation. Few of their
letters lack some allusion to her.</p>

<p>Knowledge of Lady Atkyns’ devotion to the Royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
House of France, of the sacrifices she had made, was
widespread in the world of English society, and the
Princess, having heard of her, was anxious to meet the
woman, who, more fortunate than herself, had been able
to afford some balm to the sufferings, to prevent which
she would so willingly have given her life. The Duke
of Queensberry brought about a meeting between
the two ladies. What passed between them on this
occasion? What questions did they exchange in their
eager anxiety to learn something new about the Queen?
Doubtless the most eager inquiries came from the
Princess, and bore upon the achievements of Lady
Atkyns, her visit to the Conciergerie, her talks with the
illustrious prisoner. For weeks afterwards there was
an interchange of letters between the two, in which
is clearly disclosed the state of affectionate anxiety of
the Princess’s mind. They address each other already
by their Christian names, Louise and Charlotte. Lady
Atkyns shows Mme. de Tarente the few souvenirs of
the Queen she still possessed, the last lines the Queen
wrote to her. It is touching to note, in reading their
correspondence, how every day is to them an anniversary
of some event in the life of the Queen, full of
sweet or anguishing memories.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How sad I was yesterday!” writes the Princess. “It was the
anniversary of a terrible day, when the Queen escaped assassination
only by betaking herself to the King’s apartments in the middle
of the night. Why did she escape? <i>To know you</i>—but for that
the Almighty would surely have been kind enough to her to have
let her fall a victim then.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>For all the affection which surrounds her, Mme. de
Tarente constantly bemoans her solitude.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am in the midst of the world,” she writes, “yet all alone.
Yesterday I longed so to talk of that which filled my poor heart,
but there was none who would have understood me. So I kept
my trouble to myself. I was like one of those figures you wind
up which go for a time and then stop again. I kept falling to
pieces and pulling myself together again. Ah, how sad life is!”</p>
</div>

<p>In the summer of 1797 the Princess came to a
momentous decision. The Emperor and Empress
of Russia, whom she had known formerly at the French
Court, having heard of her trials and of the not very
enviable condition in which she was living, pressed
her to come to Russia, where she would be cordially
greeted. After long hesitation she decided to accept,
but it was not without genuine heartburnings that
she separated from her English friends, from her
Charlotte most of all. She left London at the end of
July, and arrived at St. Petersburg a fortnight later.
Very soon afterwards she wrote Lady Atkyns an
account of the journey and of her first impressions
of her new surroundings.</p>

<p>The Emperor and Empress received her in their Peterhof
palace with the utmost consideration. Appointed
at once a lady-in-waiting on the Empress, she found
herself in enjoyment of many privileges attached to
this post. The house in which she was to live had
been prepared for her specially by the Emperor’s command.
Finally, she was decorated with the Order of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
St. Catherine, and the Empress on her <i>fête</i> day presented
her with her portrait. Different indeed is her
position from what it had been at Richmond.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I never drive out without four horses, and even this is my own
doing, for I ought not, as a lady-in-waiting, to have less than six.
They tell me I shall be obliged to get myself made the uniform of
the Order of St. Catherine, and that would cost me 1200 roubles,
that is, 150 louis.”</p>
</div>

<p>But the very marked favour met with by the
Princess could not but disquiet some of the courtiers
at the Palace. Within a week of her arrival, one of
the ladies in attendance upon the Empress, Mme. de
Nelidoff, at the instigation of Prince Alexandre Kourakine,
hastened to represent Mme. de Tarente’s conduct
and the unusual honour that had been shown her
under the most unfavourable light to her Majesty the
Empress; and her jealousy thus aroused (so one of
Mme. de Tarente’s friends tells the tale), she had no
difficulty in settling matters with her husband, and
when the Princess next entered the imperial presence,
the Emperor neither spoke to her nor looked at her.</p>

<p>The snub was patent, but the Princess seems to have
taken it nonchalantly enough. The friendly welcome
accorded to her by St. Petersburg society, the kindness
and affection she met with from the Golowine family,
in whose house she soon installed herself, there to
remain until her death, enabled her speedily to forget
the intrigue of her enemies at the Court. The incident
is barely alluded to in her letters to Lady Atkyns,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
which continue to be taken up chiefly with reminiscences
of their beloved Queen.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1798 the two friends are sundered
by Lady Atkyns’ decision to return to France,
impelled by the desire to be near those who had played
so important a <i>rôle</i> in her life, and to meet again those
friends who had co-operated in her work—perhaps also
to meet and question those who might be in a position
to enlighten her regarding the fate of the Dauphin.
This decision she communicates to the Princess, who
opposes it strongly, warning her against the imprudence
she is about to commit. Lady Atkyns persists, and the
Princess at last loses patience. “I have so often combated
your mad idea,” she writes nobly, “that I don’t
wish to say anything more on the subject.”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1814 the news came to St. Petersburg
of the defeat of the armies of Napoleon and the
accession of Louis XVIII. Immediately large numbers
of exiles, who were but waiting for this, made haste back
to France. Mme. de Tarente contemplated being of
their number, but before she could even make arrangements
for the journey, death came to her on January
22, 1814.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Hamburg, where our friends Mme. Cormier and the
“little Baron” took refuge in 1795, was already a
powerful city, rich by reason of its commerce, and its
governing body, conscious of its strength, were not the
less jealous of its independence. Its unique position,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
in the midst of the other German states, the neutrality
to which it clung and which it was determined should
be respected, sufficed to prevent it hitherto from looking
askance at the ever-growing triumphs of the armies of
the French Republic, and the Convention, too much
taken up with its own frontiers, had done nothing to
threaten the independence of the Hanseatic town.</p>

<p>This fact did not escape the <i>émigrés</i>, who were finding
it more and more difficult to evade the rigorous
look-out of the Revolutionary Government, and soon
Hamburg was filled with nobles, ecclesiastics, Chouans,
conspirators, Royalist agents, just as London had been
some years earlier. Safe from surprises, and in constant
communication with England, Germany, and Italy, this
world of wanderers had discovered an ideal haven in
which to hatch all their divers plots. Clubs were
started by them, called after celebrated men. Rivarol
was the centre of one set, noted for its intellectual
stamp and its verve and wit. The publications also
that saw the light in Hamburg enjoyed a wide liberty,
and this it was that opened the eyes of the Republican
Government to the state of things.</p>

<p>On September 28, 1795, there arrived at Hamburg,
Citoyen Charles-Frédéric Reinhard, official representative
of the Convention, formerly head of a department in
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Paris. There could
be no mistake about the nature of the instructions with
which this personage was provided. If the condition
of the commercial relations between the two states was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
the official pretext for his embassy, an investigation
into the affairs of the <i>émigrés</i> was its real object. The
Senate of the town were quick to realize this. However,
Reinhard’s conciliatory bearing and his expressed
dislike for the police duties imposed upon him by
the Directoire prevented his mission from having too
uncompromising an aspect. He could not shut his eyes,
of course, to what was going on, and, in spite of his
repugnance to such methods, he was forced to employ
some of the tale-bearers and spies always numerous
among the <i>émigrés</i>. In a short period a complete
system of espionage was organized. It did not attain
to the state of perfection secured by Bourienne later
under the direction of Fouché, but its existence was
enough to enhance the uneasiness of the Hamburg
Senate. Their refusal to acquiesce in certain steps
taken by the Directoire forced Reinhard to quit the
town previously, in the month of February, and to take
up his abode at Bremen, afterwards at Altona. This
suburb of Hamburg, separated from it only by an arm
of the river, was yet outside the limits of the little
republic, and suited his purpose excellently as a place
from which to conduct his observations. Everything
that went on in Hamburg was known there within a
few hours.</p>

<p>It was at this period that Reinhard received a visit
from a somewhat sinister individual, named Colleville,
who came to offer his services to the Directoire. He
volunteered to keep Reinhard informed as to the doings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
of the <i>émigrés</i>, to whom he had easy access. On March
5, 1796, he turned up with a lengthy document containing
a wealth of particulars regarding one of the
principal agents of the princes—no other than our
friend d’Auerweck, for the moment a long way from
Hamburg, but soon expected back. “He is one of the
best-informed men to be met anywhere,” Colleville
reports. “He has travelled a great deal, and is <i>au courant</i>
with the feeling of the various courts and ministers.”</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the spy was well informed
as to the character and record of the “little Baron.”
D’Auerweck would seem in intimate relations with a
certain Pictet, “Windham’s man.” Through him he
was in correspondence with Verona. He was known to
be the “friend of the Baron de Wimpfen and of a
M. de Saint-Croix, formerly Lieutenant-General in
the Bayeux district. In his report upon d’Auerweck,
Colleville had occasion inevitably to mention his friend
Cormier. He stated, in fact, that at the moment
d’Auerweck was located at Mme. Cormier’s house in
Paris in the Rue Basse-du-Rempart.</p>

<p>Colleville could not have begun his work better.
D’Auerweck was not unknown to Reinhard, who, five
months before, in a letter to Delacroix, the Minister for
Foreign Affairs, had mentioned the fact of his presence
in London, “where he was in frequent touch with du
Moustier and the former minister Montciel.”</p>

<p>By a curious coincidence, on the same day that
Reinhard got his information, the Minister of Police in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Paris, the Citoyen Cochon, had been made aware that a
congress of <i>émigrés</i> was shortly to be held at Hamburg.
The agent who sent him this announcement drew his
attention at the same time to the presence at Hamburg
of a person named Cormier.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It should be possible to find out through him the names of
those who will be taking part in the Congress. He is a magistrate
of Rennes who has been continually mixed up in intrigue. His
wife has remained in Paris.... The correspondence of this Cormier
ought to be amusing, for he is daring and has <i>esprit</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Reference is made in the same communication to
“the baron Varweck, a Hungarian, passing himself off
as an American, living in Paris for the past five
months.”</p>

<p>This was enough to arouse the attention of the
Directoire. The persistence with which the two names
reappeared proved that their efforts had not slackened.
By force of what circumstances had they been drawn
into the great intrigue against the Revolutionary Party?
It is difficult to say. For some months past Cormier’s
letters to Lady Atkyns had been gradually becoming
fewer, at last to cease altogether. Having lost all hope
in regard to the affair of the Temple, the ex-magistrate,
placing trust in the general belief as to what had
happened, came to the conclusion that it was vain to
attempt to penetrate further into the mystery, and he
decided to place his services at the disposal of the
Princes.</p>

<p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs lost no time about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
sending instructions to Reinhard, charging him to keep
a sharp watch on the meeting of the <i>émigrés</i> and to
learn the outcome of their infamous manœuvres. He
should get Colleville, moreover, to establish relations
with Cormier, “that very adroit and clever individual.”
In the course of a few days Reinhard felt in a position
to pull the strings of his system of espionage.</p>

<p>Two very different parties were formed among the
<i>émigrés</i> at Hamburg. That of the “Old Royalists,” or
of the “<i>ancien régime</i>,” would hear of nothing but the
restoration of the ancient monarchy; that of the “new
<i>régime</i>” felt that it was necessary, in order to reinstate
the monarchy, to make concessions to Republican ideas.
Cormier would seem to have belonged to the former, of
which he was the only enterprising member. His
brother-in-law, Butler, kept on the move between Paris
and Boulogne, and Calais and Dunkirk, with letters and
supplies of money from England. D’Auerweck had left
Paris now and was in England, eager to join Cormier
at Hamburg, but prevented by illness.</p>

<p>Cormier was now in open correspondence with the
King, to whom he had proposed the publication of a
gazette in the Royalist interest. He was in frequent
communication, too, with the Baron de Roll, the Marquis
de Nesle, Rivarol, and the Abbé Louis, and all the
“monarchical fanatics.” Despite his age, in short, he
was becoming more active and enterprising than ever.
Too clever not to perceive that he was being specially
watched, he was not long in getting the spy into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
own service by means of bribes, and making him
collaborate in the hoodwinking of the Minister. The
report that had got about concerning his actions, however,
disquieted the Princes, and at the end of June
Cormier is said to have received a letter from the
Comte d’Artois forbidding him “to have anything more
to say to his affairs,” and reproaching him in very sharp
terms. At the same period, Butler, to whose ears the
same report had found its way, wrote to rebuke him
severely for his indiscretion, and broke off all communication
with him. Meanwhile, he was in pecuniary
difficulties, and borrowing money from any one who
would lend, so altogether his position was becoming
critical. Soon he would have to find a refuge elsewhere.</p>

<p>When, in the autumn, Baron d’Auerweck managed to
get to Hamburg, he found his old friend in a state of
great discouragement, and with but one idea in his
head—that of getting back somehow to Paris and living
the rest of his days there in obscurity.</p>

<p>The arrival of the “18th Brumaire” and the establishment
of the Consulate facilitated, probably, the realization
of this desire. There is no record of how he brought
his sojourn at Hamburg to an end. D’Auerweck we
find offering his services to Reinhard, who formed a
high estimate of his talents. His offer, however, was not
entertained. At this point the “little Baron” also
disappears for a time from our sight.</p>

<p>It is about this period that Cormier and d’Auerweck fall
definitively apart, never again to cross each other’s path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Reassured by the calm that began to reign now in
Paris, and by the fact that other <i>émigrés</i> who had returned
to the capital were being left unmolested, Cormier
made his way back furtively one day to the Rue Basse-du-Rempart,
where the Citoyenne Butler still resided.
The former president of the Massiac Club returned to
his ancient haunts a broken-down old man. Like so
many others, he found it difficult to recognize the Paris
he now saw, transformed as it was, and turned inside
out by the Revolution. Wherever he turned, his ears
were met with the sound of one name—Bonaparte, the
First Consul. What did it all matter to him? His
return had but one object, that of re-establishing his
health and letting his prolonged absence sink into
oblivion. The continual travelling and his ups and
downs in foreign countries had brought him new maladies
in addition to his old enemy the gout. He had
lost half his fortune, through the pillaging of his estates
in San Domingo. Thus, such of his acquaintances as
had known him in the old days, seeing him now on his
return, sympathized with him in his misfortunes and
infirmities.</p>

<p>He seemed warranted, therefore, in counting upon
security in Paris. The one thing that threatened him
was that unfortunate entry in the list of <i>émigrés</i>, in
which his name figured with that of his son. In the
hope of getting the names erased, he set out one day
early in November, 1800, for the offices of the Prefecture
of the Seine. There he took the oath of fidelity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
to the Constitution. It was a step towards getting the
names definitely erased. His long stay in Hamburg
was a serious obstacle in the way, but both he and his
son looked forward confidently now to the success of
their efforts.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on August 21, 1801, a number of police
officials made their appearance at Cormier’s abode to
arrest him by order of the Minister of Police. His first
feeling was one of stupefaction. With what was he
charged? Had they got wind of his doings in England?
Had some indiscretion betrayed him? He recovered
himself, however, and led his visitors into all the various
apartments, they taking possession of all the papers
discovered, and sealing up the glass door leading into
Achille’s bedroom, he being absent at the time. This
investigation over, Cormier and the officials proceeded
to the Temple, and a few hours later he found himself
imprisoned in the Tower.</p>

<p>What thoughts must have passed through his mind
as he traversed successively those courts and alleys, and
then mounted the steps of the narrow stairway leading
to the upper storeys of the dungeon!</p>

<p>In the anguish of his position had he room in his
mind for thoughts of those days in London when the
name of the grim edifice was so often on his lips?</p>

<p>Three days passed before he could learn any clue
as to the cause of his arrest. At last, on August 24,
he was ordered to appear before a police magistrate
to undergo his trial. An account of this trial, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
<i>interrogatoire</i>, is in existence, and most curious it is to
note the way in which it was conducted. The warrant for
his arrest recorded that he was accused “of conspiracy,
and of being in the pay of the foreigner.” These terms
suggested that Cormier’s residence in England, or at
least in Hamburg, was known to his accusers. Had not
the Minister of Police in one of his portfolios a <i>dossier</i>
of some importance, full of all kinds of particulars
calculated to “do” for him? Strange to relate, there
is to be found no allusion to this doubtful past of his
in the examination.</p>

<p>After the usual inquiries as to name, age, and dwelling-place,
the magistrate proceeds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What is your occupation?”</p>

<p>“I have none except trying to get rid of gout and gravel.”</p>

<p>“Have you not been away from France during the Revolution?”</p>

<p>“I have served in the war in La Vendée against the Republic
from the beginning down to the capitulation. You will find my
deed of amnesty among my papers.”</p>

<p>“What was your grade?”</p>

<p>“I was entrusted with correspondence.”</p>

<p>“With whom did you correspond abroad?”</p>

<p>“With the different agents of the Prince—the Bishop of Arras,
the Duc d’Harcourt, Gombrieul, etc.”</p>

<p>“Did you not keep up this correspondence after you were
amnested?”</p>

<p>“I gave up all the correspondence eight months before peace was
declared.”</p>

<p>“Do you recognize this sealed cardboard box?”</p>

<p>“Yes, citoyen.”</p>
</div>

<p>And that was all! Cormier’s replies, however, so
innocent on the surface, seem to have evoked suspicion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
for on August 30 (12 Fructidor) he was brought up
again for a second examination.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With whom did you correspond especially in the West?” he
was asked.</p>

<p>“With Scépeaux, d’Antichamp, Boigny, and Brulefort.”</p>

<p>“And now what correspondence have you kept in this
country?”</p>

<p>“None whatever.”</p>

<p>“What are your relations with the Citoyen Butler?”</p>

<p>“I have had no communication these last two years, though he
is my brother-in-law.”</p>

<p>“Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“I have no idea. I know he passed through Philadelphia on
his way to San Domingo. I don’t know whether he ever got there
or whether he returned.”</p>

<p>“When was he at Philadelphia?”</p>

<p>“He must have been there or somewhere in the United States
not more than two years ago.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus no effort was made in the second inquiry any
more than in the first to search into his past. It
should be mentioned that immediately on his return
Cormier had made haste to destroy all documents that
could compromise him in any way.</p>

<p>After a detention of three weeks he was set free, his
age and infirmities doubtless having won him some
sympathy. He and his son—for Achille had been
arrested at the same time—were, however, not accorded
complete liberty, being placed <i>en surveillance</i>, and
obliged to live outside Paris. On September 20 they
were provided with a passport taking them to Etampes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
whence they were not to move away without permission
from the police.</p>

<p>At this period Fouché had immense powers, and was
organizing and regulating the enormous administrative
machine which developed under his rule into the
Ministry of Police. The prisons overflowed with men
under arrest who had never appeared before the
ordinary tribunal, “on account of the danger there
was of their being acquitted in the absence of legal
evidence against them.” He was reduced to keeping
the rest under what was styled “<i>une demi-surveillance</i>.”
His army of spies and secret agents enabled him to
keep <i>au courant</i> with their every step.</p>

<p>The reports furnished as to Cormier’s behaviour seem
to have satisfied the authorities, for at the end of a
certain time he was enabled to return to Paris. Having
learnt by experience how unsatisfactory it was to be
continually at the mercy of informers, he now set himself
energetically to trying to secure a regular and
complete amnesty. His petition was addressed to the
First Consul on June 18, 1803, and in it he described
himself as “crippled with infirmities,” and it was
covered with marginal notes strongly recommending
him to the mercy of the chief of the state.</p>

<p>At last, on October 10, the Minister of Police acceded
to his request, and Cormier received a certificate of
amnesty, freeing him henceforth from all prosecution
“on the score of emigration.” With what a sense of
relief must not this document have been welcomed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
the Rue Basse-du-Rempart! Bent under the weight of
his sufferings, Cormier enjoyed the most devoted care
at the hands of his family. His younger son, Patrice,
had returned to Paris after an existence not less
adventurous than his father’s. He had thrown himself
into the insurrection in La Vendée, and for three
years had served in the Royalist army of the Maine.
Benefiting, like his father, by the general amnesty, he
found his way back to the paternal roof in Paris,
and went into business, so as to throw a veil over his
past, until the day should come when he might appear
in uniform again.</p>

<p>Achille, the elder, devoted himself entirely to his
father, but the old man was not to enjoy much longer
the peace he had at length secured for himself. The
loss of almost all his income forced him, moreover, to
quit his residence in the Rue Basse-du-Rempart, and to
betake himself to a modest pension in the Faubourg
Saint Antoine, in which he occupied a single room, in
which he kept only a few items from the furniture of
his old home—some rose-wood chairs, a writing-table,
a desk with a marble top, a <i>prie-dieu</i>, and a small
wooden desk, “<i>dit à la Tronchin</i>.” The rest of his
furniture he sold. It was in this humble lodging that
he died on April 16, 1805, aged sixty-five. Some
months later Mme. Cormier died at the house in Rue
Basse-du-Rempart.</p>

<p>It is strange to reflect that Lady Atkyns, in the
course of her many visits to Paris, should not have ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
sought to meet again her old friend. The Emperor’s
rule was gaining in strength from day to day. Of
those who had played notable parts in the Revolution,
some, won over to the new Government, were doing
their utmost to merit by their zeal the confidence
reposed in them; the others, irreconcilable, but crushed
by the remorseless watchfulness of a police force unparalleled
in its powers, lived on forgotten, and afraid
to take any step that might attract attention to them.
This, perhaps, is the explanation of the silence of the
various actors in the drama of the Temple, once the
Empire had been established.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br><span class="small">THE “LITTLE BARON”</span></h2>
</div>



<p>Cormier’s departure did not for a single moment
interrupt the fiery activity of Baron d’Auerweck, nor
his co-operation in the most audacious enterprises of
the agents of Princes and of the Princes themselves.
He lost, it is true, a mentor whose advice was always
worthy of attention, and who had guided him up to
the present time with a certain amount of success; but
the ingenious fellow was by no means at the end of his
resources. The life which he had led for the past five
years was one which exactly suited him. A practically
never-ending list might be drawn up of acquaintances
made in the course of his continual comings and
goings, of encounters in this army of emissaries serving
the counter-Revolution, and of particularly prosperous
seasons. Besides the d’Antraigues, the Fauche-Borels,
and the Dutheils, there was a regular army of subordinates,
bustling about Europe as though it were a
vast anthill.</p>

<p>Amongst them d’Auerweck could not fail to be
prominent, and he was soon marked as a clever and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
resourceful agent. His sojourn in Hamburg also
continued to arouse curiosity and observation on the
part of the representatives of the Directoire. They
recognized now that he was employed and paid by
England. “He serves her with an activity worthy
of the Republican Government,” Reinhard wrote to
Talleyrand; and it was well known that Peltier’s former
collaborator, always an energetic journalist, assisted in
editing the <i>Spectateur du Nord</i>.</p>

<p>An unlooked-for opportunity to exploit his talent
soon offered itself to d’Auerweck.</p>

<p>The Deputies of the ten states, which at that time
formed the Empire, had been brought together by the
congress which opened at Rastadt on December 9, 1797,
and for eighteen months there was an extraordinary
amount of visits to and departures from the little
town in Baden. The presence of Bonaparte, who had
arrived some days before the commencement of the
conference in an eight-horse coach, with a magnificent
escort, and welcomed throughout his journey as the
victor of Arcole, increased the solemnity and scope
of the negotiations. All the diplomatists, with their
advisers, their secretaries, and their clerks, crowded
anxiously round him. Agents from all the European
Powers came to pick up greedily any scraps of information,
and to try to worm out any secrets that might
exist. Rastadt was full to overflowing of spies and
plotters, and the name of this quiet, peaceful city,
hitherto so undisturbed, was in every one’s mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>From Hamburg the “little Baron” followed attentively
the first proceedings of the Congress through
the medium of the newspapers, but the sedentary life
which he was leading began to worry him. In vain he
wrote out all day long never-ending political treatises,
crammed with learned notes on the European situation,
wove the most fantastic systems, and drew up “a plan
for the partition of France, which he proposed to a certain
M. du Nicolay;” all this was not sufficient for him.
D’Auerweck was on friendly terms with the Secretary
of the French Legation, Lemaître by name (who, by
the way, had no scruples about spying on him some
years later, and informed against him without a blush),
and, giving full play “to his romantic imagination and
to his taste for sensational enterprises,” he one day
submitted to his confidant a scheme to “kidnap the
Minister, Reinhard, and carry him off to London; his
attendants were to be made intoxicated, his coachman
to be bribed, ten English sailors to be hidden on the
banks of the Elbe!” At the back of these schemes
of mystery there figured a certain “Swiss and Genevan
Agency,” which at the proper time would, he declared,
generously reimburse them for all their expenditure.
But, for all these foolish imaginings, d’Auerweck displayed
a knowledge of the world and a sound judgment
which struck all those who came in contact with him,
and it was certain that with strong and firm guidance
he was capable of doing much good and useful work.
In the winter of 1798 we are told that “he left Hamburg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
secretly” for an unknown destination. Lemaître believed
that he had buried himself “in the depths of
Silesia,” but he had no real knowledge of his man.
For, as a matter of course, d’Auerweck was bound to be
attracted to such a centre of affairs as Rastadt then
was, in order to make the most profitable use of his
ingenuity, seeing that, according to report, the British
Government, which was making use of his services, in
fear of being kept in the dark as to what was going on,
had begged him “to go and exercise his wits in another
place.”</p>

<p>He made Baden his headquarters, for the proximity
of Rastadt, and his intimacy with the de Gelb family,
which has already been mentioned, led him to prefer
Baden to the actual field of battle, at which place he
must have come under suspicion as an old English
agent. One of the Austrian envoys at the Congress
was Count Lehrbach; and d’Auerweck managed to get
into relations with him, and even to be allowed to
do secretarial work for him, on the strength of the
connection which he declared he had possessed with
Minister Thugut during the early days of the Revolution
and the confidence which had lately been reposed
in him. He had reason to hope that with the help of
his ability and his gift of languages he would soon be
able to secure active employment. And, indeed, it was
in this way that d’Auerweck succeeded in re-establishing
himself at once, to his great satisfaction, as an active
agent, with a footing in the highest places, ferreting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
out the secrets of the Ambassadors, and carrying on an
underhand correspondence openly. His intention was,
doubtless, to return to Austria as soon as the Congress
was over, by the help of Count Lehrbach, and there to
regain the goodwill of his former patron, the Minister
Thugut.</p>

<p>But the sanguinary drama which brought the Conference
to such an abrupt conclusion completely spoiled
his plans and undid his most brilliant combinations.
We can realize the universal feeling of consternation
throughout the whole of Europe which was caused by
the news that on the evening of April 28, 1799, the
French Ministers, Bonnier, Roberjot, and Debry, who
had just made up their minds to betake themselves to
Strasburg, along with their families, their servants,
and their records—a party filling eight carriages—had
been openly attacked as they were leaving Rastadt by
Barbaczy’s Hussars; that the two first-mentioned
gentlemen had been dragged from their carriages and
treacherously murdered, and that the third, Debry, had
alone escaped by a miracle. Even if the outrage of
Rastadt was “neither the cause nor the pretext of the
war of 1799,” its consequences were, nevertheless, very
serious.</p>

<p>One of these consequences, and not the least important,
was that Bonaparte’s police, magnificently
reorganized by Fouché, redoubled its shepherding of
<i>émigrés</i> and agents of the Princes, who swarmed
in the country-side between Basle, the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
headquarters of the spies, and Mayence. Once an arrest
took place, the accused was certain to be suspected of
having had a hand in the assassination of the plenipotentiaries,
and if by any bad luck he was unable to
deny having been present in the district, he found it a
very difficult task to escape from the serious results of
this accusation.</p>

<p>A few months after this stirring event, Baron
d’Auerweck, tired of such a stormy existence, and
seeing, perhaps, a shadow of the sword of Damocles
hanging over his head, determined himself to break
away from this life of agitation, and to settle down
with a wife. During the last days of the year 1799
he was married at Baden to Mademoiselle Fanny de
Gelb, a native of Strasburg, whose father had lately
served under Condé; she also had a brother who was
an officer in the army of the Princes. But, in spite of
a pension which the mother, Madame de Gelb, was
paid by England on account of her dead husband’s
services, the available resources of the future establishment
were very meagre indeed, for the “little Baron”
had not learned to practise economy while rushing
about Europe; so, as soon as the marriage had been
celebrated, the turn of the wheel of fortune forced the
young wife to leave the Grand Duchy of Baden and to
wander from town to town in Germany and Austria.</p>

<p>They travelled first to Munich and then to Nuremburg,
but d’Auerweck’s plans were to establish himself
in Austria close to all his belongings. He had the fond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
hope of obtaining employment from Minister Thugut,
to whom he reintroduced himself. But he experienced a
bitter disappointment, for on his first attempt to submit
to his Excellency the greater part of his last work (in
which he had embodied, as the result of desperate toil,
his views on the present political situation, the outcome
of his conversations with the representatives of the
different European states, his reflections and his forecast
of events) d’Auerweck found himself unceremoniously
dismissed. Thugut flatly refused, if the story is to be
believed, to have anything further to do with a man
who was still suspected of being an English emissary.
Consequently he was obliged to abandon his idea of
establishing himself in Austria, and to hunt for other
means of existence, more particularly as Madame
d’Auerweck had just presented him with his first child
at Nuremburg. He turned his steps once again in the
direction of the Grand Duchy, and after successive
visits to Friburg, Basle, and Baden, he decided to make
his home in Schutterwald, a village on the outskirts of
the town of Offenburg. There he determined to lead
the life of a simple, honest citizen, and renting a very
humble peasant’s cottage, he installed his wife and his
mother-in-law therein. He himself set to work on the
cultivation of his garden, devoting his spare moments
to writing, so as not to lose the knack, the sequel to his
<i>Philosophical and Historical Reflections</i>.</p>

<p>He soon got to know his neighbours and all the inhabitants
of the country very well. He was considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
to be a quiet, unenterprising man, “with a positive dislike
for politics, although loquacious and vain.” It was
impossible to find out anything about his past life, for
the prudent Baron considered it inadvisable to talk of
this subject, but he was always looked upon “as an
argumentative man, who wanted to know all that was
going on, whether in reference to agriculture, to thrift,
or to politics.” In spite of the apparent tranquillity in
which he was allowed to remain, d’Auerweck followed
with a certain amount of anxiety all the events which
were happening not far from him, on the frontier of the
Rhine. Troops were continually passing to and fro in
this district; the French were close at hand, and their
arrival at Offenburg inspired a feeling of vague unrest
in him, although he never recognized, to tell the truth,
the danger which threatened him. He had taken the
precaution to destroy, before coming to Switzerland, his
vast collection of papers: all that mass of correspondence
which had been accumulating for the last few
years, those reports and instructions, all of which constituted
a very compromising record. At last, after a
residence of some months, to make matters safe, he
contrived, thanks to his marriage, to be enrolled as a
freeman of the Grand Duchy; for it seemed to him
that as a subject of Baden he would be relieved of all
further cause of alarm.</p>

<p>But all d’Auerweck’s fears were reawakened by the
much-talked-of news of the Duc d’Enghien’s arrest on
March 15, 1804, and by the details of how the Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
had been captured openly in the jurisdiction of Baden,
at Ettenheim, that is to say, only a short distance from
Offenburg. He absented himself for some days from
Schutterwald, so the story goes, and took himself to the
mountains.</p>

<p>Just at the same time there arrived at the offices of the
Ministry of Police in Paris a succession of memoranda,
mostly anonymous, referring to Baron d’Auerweck, and
to his presence in the neighbourhood of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Some of them came from Lemaître, Reinhard’s former
secretary at Hamburg. Many of them, inexact and
inaccurate as they were with regard to the details of the
alleged facts, agreed on this point, viz. that the individual
“was one of those men, who are so powerful for
good or bad, that the security of every Government
requires complete information as to their resting-places
and their doings.” Then followed a medley of gossiping
insinuations, the precise import of which it was difficult
to discover.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall never forget,” said one, “that, when d’Auerweck left
Hamburg two months before the assassination of the French
Ministers in order to take up his quarters only three leagues away
from Rastadt, he said: ‘<i>I am about to undertake an operation which
will make a great sensation, and which will render great service to the
cause of the Coalition</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Now supervenes a whole year, during which his doings and his
whereabouts are most carefully concealed,” wrote another; “however,
I am certain that he is acting and working pertinaciously against
the interests of France. I have heard him make this remark:
‘<i>We shall take some time doing it, but at last we shall conquer you</i>.’”
A third added: “His tranquillity and his silence are but masks for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
his activity, and I, for one, could never be persuaded that he has
all of a sudden ceased to correspond with <i>Lord Grenville</i> in London,
with the <i>Count de Romanzof</i>, with a certain <i>Nicolai</i> in St.
Petersburg, with <i>Prince Belmonte</i>, with the <i>Chevalier de Saint-Andre</i>,
with <i>Roger de Damas</i> in Italy, with <i>Dumoustier</i>, who is, I believe, a
Hohenlohe Prince in Berlin, and directly with the Count de Lille.”
Finally, d’Auerweck, according to the same report, “complaisantly
displayed a spot in the shape of the fleur-de-lys, inside his fist,
declaring that ‘this is a sign of descent; it is a mark of predestination;
I of all men am bound to devote myself and assist in
the return of the Bourbons!’”</p>
</div>

<p>It would be a fatal mistake to believe that these fairy
tales, all vague and absurd as they often were, remained
lost and forgotten in the despatch-boxes of the Ministry
of Police. The region, near as it was to Rastadt, where
d’Auerweck was reported to have made his appearance,
was a valuable and important indication, which of itself
was sufficient to make the man an object for watchful
suspicion. The ominous nature of the times must, of
course, be remembered. Fouché, who had just been
restored to favour, and had been placed for the second
time at the head of the Ministry of Police, was anxious
to prove his zeal afresh, to please the Emperor and
to deserve his confidence, while his mind was still
troubled by the execution of the Duc d’Enghien, by the
exploits of Georges Cadoudal, and by the discovery of
the English Agency at Bordeaux, which were all fitting
reasons for attracting the Minister’s attention and for
exciting his curiosity. So, when on October 11, 1804,
his Excellency decided to make further searching investigations
into d’Auerweck’s case, and gave precise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
orders to the prefects of the frontier departments of the
Grand Duchy, it is doubtful whether he was careful to
note in his charge the principal reasons for attaching
suspicion upon the Baron, viz. those which had to do
with the assassination of the plenipotentiaries at
Rastadt.</p>

<p>It was some time before the required information
could be obtained, and though the first inquiries about
d’Auerweck made by Desportes, the prefect of the
Upper Rhine, added little in the way of news, they
agreed, nevertheless, in certifying that the Baron lived
very quietly in the outskirts of Offenburg—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“that he there devoted himself entirely to his agricultural occupations,
and that the kind of life he led did not foster any suspicion
that he kept up his old campaigns of intrigue.”</p>
</div>

<p>Six months later, Desportes, in returning to the
subject, showed himself more positive than ever, for he
affirmed—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“that no active correspondence can be traced to d’Auerweck, and
that he saw scarcely any one. He is a man of a caustic and
critical turn of mind, who often lets himself go in conversation
without reflection in his anxiety to talk brilliantly. A point which
is particularly reassuring about him is that he is without credit,
without fortune, and of no personal account, and that if he wanted
to mix himself up afresh in intrigues he would choose some other
place than Offenburg, where there are now only three <i>émigrés</i>, the
youngest of whom is seventy-seven years of age.”</p>
</div>

<p>But, in spite of these very positive statements, the
Minister preserved his attitude of mistrust, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
strengthened by the arrival of fresh notes, in which the
same denunciations of the “little Baron” were repeated.
He was described as being “restless by inclination,
violently fanatical in all his opinions, and longing to
make himself notorious by some startling act.” But
his position was made worse by the information which
was received, that in the autumn of 1805 d’Auerweck
had absented himself from home for several days,
frightened, no doubt, by the proximity of the French
armies, which were dotted about on the banks of the
Rhine. How could this sudden flight be accounted
for? And his alarm at the sight of the Emperor’s
soldiers at close quarters? Such conduct struck Fouché
as being very suspicious. He ordered a supplementary
inquiry, and this time he did not content himself with
the information afforded by the prefect of the Upper
Rhine, but let loose one of his best bloodhounds on
his scent. At the time, two years ago, when preparations
were being made for the kidnapping of the Duc
d’Enghien and for watching his residence at Ettenheim,
recourse was had to the services of the Commissary of
Police, Popp by name, who was stationed at Strasburg.
In this frontier town near Basle an active and intelligent
man was needed, who could maintain a constant watch
on the underhand practices of the Royalist agents.
Commissary Popp seemed to be made for the job. His
handling of the Duc d’Enghien’s affairs earned the
approval of Napoleon; and Fouché, since his reinstatement
in the Ministry, recognized in him a clever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
and expert functionary, on whom he could always
count.</p>

<p>This was the man who was charged with the task of
spying on d’Auerweck, and throughout the whole of
1806 Popp was hard at work on this mission. His
original authentications differed very little from what
Desportes had written, and there was nothing to prove
that the Baron had in any way departed from his passive
attitude.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have not discovered,” wrote Popp on April 22, 1806, “that
he is in correspondence with the English agitation, or that he shows
any inclination to excite and embitter people’s tempers. I believe
that he, like many others, is more to be pitied than to be feared.”</p>
</div>

<p>Some weeks later Popp managed to loosen the tongue
of an ecclesiastic, a dweller in those parts, and from him
he got information about the business and movements
of the Baron. “He is quite absorbed in rural economy,
which is his chief thought to all appearances,” he
reported to Fouché; but then, stung to the quick by
the repeated orders of his chief (who never ceased from
impressing upon him the necessity for the closest watch
on d’Auerweck’s traffickings), Popp, impatient for an
opportunity to prove his zeal, began to magnify his
words by introducing subtle insinuations.</p>

<p>By this time d’Auerweck had come to the conclusion
that his stay at Schutterwald was too uncomfortable,
and having heard of a bit of land at a reasonable price
in Elgersweier, which was not far from Offenburg,
indeed about the same distance from the town, he made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
up his mind to take shelter there and to build a little
house, which would be his own property. The question
was asked how could he, whom every one looked upon
as a penniless man, obtain the funds required to complete
this bargain? Without doubt he borrowed from
his mother-in-law, Madame de Gelb, who had always
lived with him, and whose modest income was so
pleasantly augmented by the pension which she received
from the English Government. And so, in the middle
of the summer of 1806, the “little Baron” transported
his penates to Elgersweier, where he settled his belongings
very comfortably. By this time two other sons,
Armand and Louis, had been added to the one born at
Munich, and shortly after arriving at the new home
Madame d’Auerweck gave birth to a daughter, who was
named Adelaide.</p>

<p>Commissary Popp knew all about these happenings,
and his supervision never slackened for an instant.
Encouraged by his success in arranging the preliminaries
for the affair at Ettenheim, he was perfectly prepared
to repeat the operation. With this in view, he began to
show the Minister, in ambiguous language at first, his
very good and sufficient reasons for desiring d’Auerweck’s
presence in France. If necessary, he urged, we
could easily get permission from the Grand Duke of
Baden to arrest him in his own home. This suggestion
was expressed very cautiously at first, but was soon
made more explicit, although there was not the slightest
shadow of an excuse for such violence, for all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
statements “agreed in demonstrating the perfectly
peaceful nature of the “little Baron’s” existence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It would be advisable to make certain of his person,” wrote
Popp, “and my opinion will always be the same if certain difficulties
with the House of Austria happen to be renewed; for d’Auerweck,
posted as a sentinel on the opposite bank, and doubtless possessing
friends on our side, would be one of the very first bearers of information
about our military position and political topography.”</p>
</div>

<p>About the same time, Bourrienne, one of Minister
Reinhard’s successors at Hamburg, arrested an <i>émigré</i>
who had lately landed from London, and who was
supposed to be in possession of important secrets.
This was the Viscount de Butler, Cormier’s half-brother,
who, after having “worked,” as we have seen, for the
Royalist Committee in London, now found himself
stranded in Hamburg in the greatest misery. It was
decided to send him to Paris, as he offered to give up
certain documents. He was imprisoned in the Temple,
and there questioned by Desmarets, who extracted from
him all kinds of information with regard to his missions.
Naturally, Butler related all he knew about d’Auerweck,
how he had made his acquaintance, and what sort of
terms he was on with Dutheil and with Lord Grenville.
As his answers proved satisfactory he was sent back to
Hamburg, where Bourrienne continued to make use of
him for many years.</p>

<p>Finally, to complete the bad luck, the police were
warned of a certain Sieur de Gelb, a former officer in
the army of the Princes, whose behaviour had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
discovered to be very mysterious, and who paid frequent
visits to the frontier. Now, this <i>émigré</i> was no other
than Baron d’Auerweck’s brother-in-law.</p>

<p>All these stories, cleverly made the most of and carefully
improved upon, served to greatly excite the curiosity
of the Minister of Police, all the more as the Royalists
were showing much increased activity in many places.
To add to the effect, Normandy became the theatre of
several audacious surprises, such as coaches being robbed,
convoys plundered, and attacks on the high road, many
of which were the handiwork of the inhabitants of
the castle of Tournebut, led by the Viscount d’Aché
and the famous Chevalier. Besides, the Emperor was
waging war in Prussia at the head of his armies, a
thousand leagues from Paris, and in his absence the
conspirators’ audacity redoubled; but he did not lose
sight of them, and from his distant camps he kept so
closely in touch with all that was happening in France
that he compelled Fouché’s incessant vigilance. An
event which took place next year, when war with
Germany broke out afresh, clearly demonstrated once
more the danger of attracting for too long the attention
of his Excellency the Minister of Police.</p>

<p>One evening, in the month of June, 1807, a policeman
on his rounds noticed in one of the squares in the town
of Cassel a young man behaving very strangely, and
speechifying in the middle of a crowd. He drew near,
and ascertained that the individual, who was very
excited, was pouring forth a stream of insults and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
threats against Napoleon, whom he went so far as to
call “a good-for-nothing scamp.” This was quite enough
to decide the representative of public order upon arresting
the silly fellow. He was taken off to the police
station and questioned. He stated that his name was
Jean-Rodolphe Bourcard, “formerly a ribbon manufacturer,”
aged twenty-three years, and that he was a native
of Basle, in Switzerland. In the course of his examination
it was discovered that he had arrived the same day
from Hamburg, and that he was full of some very suspicious
projects. His story caused him to be suspected,
and a report was promptly drawn up for transmission
to Paris. Cassel was destined before very long to become
the capital of the new kingdom of Westphalia, created
for Jerome Bonaparte, and the police supervision of
<i>émigrés</i> was exercised as strictly there as in every other
part of France. While waiting for orders a search was
made in the lodging-house whence the prisoner had
come. Nothing much was found in his scanty luggage;
some papers, one of which was “a plan and a description
of the battle of Austerlitz,” and besides this two or
three apparently mysterious notes. One of them contained
the words: “<i>Must see Louis—without Louis
nothing can be done</i>.” Everything was minutely collected
together, and some days later Bourcard was sent off for
a compulsory visit to Paris.</p>

<p>He was put in the Temple, and, although it was easy
to see from his talk and his strange behaviour that he
was a madman, subject to fits of violence, Fouché could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
not make up his mind to let him go. The examination
of his record and the papers which were found in his
possession had suddenly given the Minister an ingenious
idea. Who could this <i>Louis</i> be who was obviously
connected with Bourcard? Certainly a Royalist spy,
since the man of Basle had just come from Hamburg,
the headquarters of these people. And the Record
Office of the Ministry contained many notes referring
to a “well-known agent of England and of Austria,”
Baron Louis d’Auerweck of Steilengels, who was known
to be living on the banks of the Rhine. There was no
room for doubt: this person “had assumed the name of
Louis in the various missions which he had undertaken.”
Was not this the man who was denoted by Bourcard’s
note?</p>

<p>Fouché was fascinated by this solution, and, anxious
to have it verified, he seized upon the unhoped-for
opportunity which had presented itself. And that
was why an order was sent from Paris on July 17,
1807, to immediately effect the arrest of the “little
Baron.” It would, however, have been impolitic and
almost impossible to make use of the same violent
measures which had been employed in the Duc d’
Enghien’s case. Besides, Massias, the French Chargé
d’Affaires at the Grand Duke of Baden’s court at
Carlsruhe, when he received Fouché’s letter, considered
it necessary, in order to carry out his chiefs commands,
to obtain the Grand Duke’s permission and assistance
before moving in the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But,” he wrote to Fouché, “my seven years’ experience had
firmly convinced me that, if I ask for this person’s arrest by the
ordinary process of an official letter, he will be warned and will
manage to make his escape, so I think I should set off the same day
for Baden, where the Baron de Gemmingen, the Cabinet Minister,
is now staying with his Royal Highness, for I have on several
occasions received proofs of his kindly disposition towards me.”</p>
</div>

<p>Massias was not mistaken; his application to the
Sovereign of Baden met with immediate and complete
success. For the latter, who knew none of the details of
the case—not even that d’Auerweck was his own subject—and
did not want to offend the Emperor, listened to
his representatives petition, and the same day issued
orders, from his palace of La Favorite in the outskirts
of Baden, to M. Molitor, the Grand Ducal Commissary,
to act in concert with Massias, and with the help of
the police of Baden to arrest Baron d’Auerweck. For
Massias had pointed out that if the order were sent
in the first place to the bailiff of Offenburg, “where
d’Auerweck must have formed many friendships,” there
were a thousand reasons for fearing that the latter
would receive warning, “for he is a vigilant man and
is on his guard.” At Elgersweier no one had the
slightest inkling of the impending danger. The “little
Baron” had just returned from one of those expeditions
which the police were watching so carefully, and had
gone in to see his wife, who had lately given birth
to her fourth child. For d’Auerweck had settled
down a short time before in his new home, and
was perfectly content to enjoy the peaceful existence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
which allowed him to move about and finish his <i>Historical
Notes on Hugues Capet</i>, and his <i>Dissertation upon
the Secularization of Germany under French Methods</i>.</p>

<p>So it can be imagined what a crushing blow was
dealt him when Commissary Molitor and his assistants
appeared at Elgersweier unexpectedly on the evening
of July 23, 1807. We can picture the “little Baron’s”
agitation, his distorted face, as he went himself to
admit the police officers; his wife’s despair; the house
rummaged from cellar to garret; the cries of the
children woken up by the hubbub; Madame de Gelb’s
indignation; and then the setting forth, in the midst
of the police, of the unhappy head of the family, in
spite of his useless protestations, and the broken-hearted
family, overwhelmed by stupefaction, in their ravished
home.</p>

<p>The prisoner soon recovered his presence of mind,
and at Offenburg, where he was taken, he set to work
to prepare his defence to the best of his ability, and
he soon drew up a justificatory document, which was
designed to confound his accusers. At the same time—luckily
for d’Auerweck—the Grand Duke found out
that it was one of his subjects who was concerned, and
he withdrew the authority for arrest which he had
given, and issued orders to keep the Baron and his
papers for his disposal. The preliminary examination
of these documents plainly demonstrated the flimsy
nature of the charge, and that there was no justification
for the outrage which had been committed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>The day after the fateful event, Madame de Gelb went
to La Favorite, and, throwing herself at her Sovereign’s
feet, implored him to protect her son-in-law. She
described the falsity of the charges brought against
him, the distress of the mother and of the four children.
The Grand Duke could not but be touched by this
petition, although he was anxious not to displease
M. Fouché.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am transported with delight,” Massias said to Councillor
Gemmingen, “at having so successfully executed the commands of
the Minister of Police, for they were not easy of accomplishment;”
and he added, in order to appease the Grand Duke’s fears and
regrets, “This affair seems to have taken a turn, which is very
fortunate for the prisoner; and I have already advised his
Excellency the Minister about it. You can assure his Royal
Highness that I will do my very best to finish off the case in a
way that shall be agreeable to both Governments.”</p>
</div>

<p>But such a result seemed very unlikely, for it would
have required very strong compulsion to make Fouché
renounce his plan, more especially now that the arrest
was an accomplished fact. It seemed absolutely necessary
to him to extradite d’Auerweck and to fetch him
to Paris; and he had already, by August 5, warned
the Prefect of the department of Mont Tonnerre and
Moncey, the Inspector-General of Police, to be in
readiness “to take charge of and to escort Lord
d’Auerweck.”</p>

<p>It was just at this time that Commissary Popp,
whose assistance had not been utilized as much as he
hoped it would be, began to be worried by the silence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
which was observed as far as he was concerned, and he
entreated his Minister not to allow the Baron to slip
out of his hands.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was very distasteful to have to make this arrest,” he said,
“and it was only effected because it was necessary; and you can
guess how carefully, under these circumstances, we have examined
his papers, which it was of supreme importance to lay our hands
upon.”</p>
</div>

<p>However, these papers, which Popp so confidently
reckoned would expose the Baron’s intrigues, were
found to consist only of purely private correspondence,
altogether wanting in political interest; besides the
historical works undertaken by d’Auerweck, the search
of his house had only brought to light some insignificant
letters, amongst which were “a bundle of love
letters which d’Auerweck had exchanged with a young
<i>émigrée</i> now settled in London. It appears that this
entanglement did not meet with the approval of the
young lady’s uncle, the girl having lost her parents
when she was fifteen years of age.”</p>

<p>The Grand Duke, having heard these particulars, was
all the more unwilling to hand over his unfortunate
subject to Fouché and his myrmidons. He was convinced
“of his perfect innocence.” Therefore the Baron
de Dalberg, his Ambassador in Paris, was charged “to
urge His Excellency, Minister Fouché, most forcibly
to cease from troubling these persons, who were very
sincerely to be pitied.” But he only encountered the
most obstinate resistance. Fouché had received the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
plea of exculpation, which d’Auerweck had drawn up
two days after his arrest, but he decided it was insufficient,
“because it only touched lightly on many of the
principal details of his intrigues, and it did not refer at
all to his doings before 1800,” and in the margin of the
sheet he recorded his sentiments in a kind of cross-examination.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With whom had he had dealings since his second journey to
Paris? Where did he lodge? To whom in London had he written?
Did he not hide himself in a house in the Rue Basse-du-Rempart?</p>

<p>“What commission had he been charged with at Rastadt? Had
he not made this extraordinary remark to some one before he left
Hamburg: ‘<i>I am going to Rastadt; you will soon hear of a great
event, in which I shall have had a hand</i>’”?</p>
</div>

<p>And Fouché went on to allude to the Baron’s hurried
flight at the time when the French troops were drawing
near.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Why did you fly at the time of the commencement of hostilities?
You are not a Frenchman? If you had not intrigued against
France, or even if you had ceased to intrigue, why did you leave
your wife because our troops were about to arrive, since you were a
German and settled in Germany on the territory of a Prince, who
is on good terms with this same France? But we have reason to
believe that you were still carrying on your intrigues. We have
reason to think that you came secretly to Paris five or six months
ago. You were seen in the Rue de Richelieu. Further, we have
reason to think that, stationed as you were on our frontier, you
were perilously inclined by your long experience as a spy to continue
to spy on us, and that you did not confine yourself to a correspondence
with our enemies, but actually controlled men of the class
of those whom you directed at Rastadt according to your own
acknowledgment.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>Such were the complaints formulated by the Minister,
and they were sufficient, it must be admitted, to convince
him of the importance of his capture. Even if
the Baron’s past life since 1800 could be voluntarily
ignored—although this past life could not fail to arouse
a host of just suspicions—there still remained his complicity
in the drama of Rastadt, and also the coincidence—though
not a very convincing one—of Bourcard’s
arrest with the Baron’s presence on the banks of the
Rhine. So Fouché, in his reply to Baron de Dalberg,
who had begged him to comply with his requests,
wished to show that he had made up his mind.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You understand, monsieur, from what has passed,” he wrote on
August 29, “that Baron d’Auerweck cannot be set free, and that it
is necessary to convey him to Paris in order to give his explanation
of the fresh and singular information which has been received
about him. Your Excellency may rest assured that his examination
will be conducted with perfect impartiality, such as he may
desire, and that he will obtain the fullest justice, if he can clear
himself.”</p>
</div>

<p>The unfortunate Baron had now been kicking his
heels for more than a month in the jail at Offenburg,
where he was kept under observation day and night by
a sentinel. The heat was intense, and d’Auerweck,
suffering as he was from an internal complaint, which
made his detention all the harder to bear, cursed his
bad luck. He reproached his Sovereign in picturesque
language with having allowed him to be imprisoned
without any proof of crime upon “knavish accusations,”
him—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“a citizen, a man of valour, whose honour no man doubts; whose
fair dealing every one confides in; who is not ashamed to show his
love of religion, and whose life is by no means a useless one; who
has sufficient brains to have principles, and sufficient heart to
sacrifice himself for his principles when they demand it; whose
head and heart are in harmony; who has taken no part in political
events except according to his oath and his duty; who, in short,
has for the past five years lived as a peasant in a little house,
which he had built himself, there tending his garden and rearing
his children.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Grand Duke, touched by the truth of these
reproaches, did his best to avoid granting Fouché’s
demand. He believed he had hit upon an expedient
when he proposed to the Minister to send the prisoner
only as far as Strasburg, where the French Justiciary
could examine him comfortably. But Fouché showed
himself unmanageable, so fifteen days later the Grand
Duke, tired of the struggle, and with the excuse of
“the ties of friendship and the peculiar harmony which
existed with the French Court,” at last consented to the
extradition of Baron D’Auerweck, although—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His Highness considered that he had the right to expect to be
spared the unpleasantness of having to hand over to a foreign jurisdiction
one of his subjects, against whom there did not exist any
properly established suspicions, and whose papers furnished no proof
against him.”</p>
</div>

<p>Once again the wrathful spectre of Napoleon, ready
to crush the man who opposed his will, had succeeded
in triumphing over everything which could be hoped
for from justice and good laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>On September 22 Commissary Molitor took d’Auerweck
out of the prison of Offenburg and brought
him to Strasburg to hand him over to the French
police. In order to preserve precedent and to save his
face, the Grand Duke had ordered his councillor to
announce that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“although His Royal Highness, in his particular condescension,
had allowed his subject Auerweck to be extradited so as to facilitate
the information and accusations which were brought against him
this was done in full confidence that he would be treated as considerately
as possible, and that he would not be subjected to any
unpleasant or harsh treatment in consideration of the peculiar
circumstances of his case.”</p>
</div>

<p>But what M. Fouché’s instructions were was well
known, and no one had any misconception on the
subject, least of all the Grand Duke. The pitiful letter
which Madame d’Auerweck sent to him next day, and
in which she appealed to his kind heart and his pity,
must certainly have aroused some feeling of remorse.</p>

<p>After a stay of forty-eight hours in Strasburg,
d’Auerweck started on his journey on September
25. In the post-chaise which carried him were a
junior officer and a policeman, charged with his care.
After crossing the Vosges, they travelled by way of
Nancy and Chalons, and reached Epernay on the 28th;
in a few hours they would arrive in Paris. Taking
advantage of a short halt in the inn, the Baron
hurriedly scribbled the following note, which was
intended to reassure his family:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have arrived here, my good and tender friend, as well in health
as I could hope to be, and much less tired than I feared. I write
these few words to you to calm your mind, and to beg you again to
take care of yourself. To-morrow, by eight o’clock in the morning,
we shall be in Paris, whence, as I hope, I shall be able to write to
you. I embrace you, and beg you to kiss Charles, Louis, Armand,
and your mother for me.</p>

<p>“May God guard you.</p>

<p>“Epernai, 28th September.”</p>
</div>

<p>The post-chaise entered Paris in the morning of the
29th, and passed along the quays till it stopped in
front of the general office of the Minister of Police,
where the prisoner had to be delivered. Where would
they take him? For certain to the Temple tower,
where at this time political prisoners were kept. And
there it was that d’Auerweck was conducted and
locked up. The order in the gaol-book directed that
he should be placed in solitary confinement until
further notice. It was now the Baron’s turn to enter
the gloomy dungeon, which he had so often, twelve
years before, gazed at curiously from afar. It was his
fate, like his “big friend” Cormier, to closely inspect
this building, the name of which evoked such reminiscences
of mystery.</p>

<p>Six days were allowed him in which to prepare,
without disturbance, his reply to the questions which
were to be put to him. On October 5, 1807, a
commissary, sent by the Minister of Police, came to
see him and to hear what he had to say. A curious
thing was that the same proceeding which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
employed with Cormier at the time of his imprisonment
was renewed for d’Auerweck’s benefit; no reference
whatever was made to the whole period antecedent to
1800. Whatever might have been d’Auerweck’s conduct
during the Revolution and under the Directoire,
what his actions were, in what direction he went and
came, who were his friends, all these points were held
of no importance by his Excellency M. Fouché, and
by Desmarets, who was on special duty in connection
with the case. What they were most concerned with
was to find out the object of d’Auerweck’s frequent
absences during the last few years, and to extort a confession
from him of his participation in the murder of
the plenipotentiaries of Rastadt. They came to the
point without any concealment, but d’Auerweck was
on his guard. He flatly denied that he had paid a visit
to Paris in the months of April and May, as was
alleged.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I did not travel at all in France, and I have not been in Paris
since the year when the Directoire was installed. I can furnish
the clearest proofs of this fact. I was warned two years ago that
the French police were watching me, and that they accused me of a
number of intrigues, the greater part of which I had nothing whatever
to do with, for I declare most solemnly that since the July or
September of 1799 I have taken no part in any matter against
France. I challenge the world to allege a single proceeding of
mine, or a single line, against the interests of the French Government.
The person who warned me that the French were watching
me was the late Abbe Desmares, who lived in Offenburg; the
warning was conveyed in an anonymous letter, to which he never
owned up, but which I am convinced came from him.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>As regards his sudden flight from Baden at the time
of the approach of the French armies, the Baron explained
that it was due to his desire to appease the
fears of his mother-in-law, Madame de Gelb. Besides,
they had only to question the authorities of Rothenburg,
of Ulm, and of Nuremberg, and to obtain from
them the counterfoils of his passports, in order to find
an absolute confirmation of his statements. Then there
was the question of his connection with Bourcard.
What could the accused reply to that? Was it not at
Ulm itself that he had met “Monsieur Bourcard, the
father, who was an official from the Canton of Basle?”
D’Auerweck’s answer was ready:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have not spent more than twenty-four hours in Ulm. I had
my dinner and supper there. The Austrian army had not at that
time been forced back upon the town, which was being fortified. I
only saw three officers at the <i>table d’hôte</i>, two of them Croatians and
one German captain. I had no kind of business with any one.
The man called Bourcard, a Swiss official, is quite unknown to me.”</p>
</div>

<p>All his denials were very precise—and they were
easily to be verified by the means he had suggested—so
that there was now very little left of the terrible
evidence which weighed so heavily upon the “little
Baron,” or of “the crime of conspiracy against the
security of the State,” with which he was charged. The
slight clue, indicated by Bourcard’s arrest, but damaged
by the papers seized at Elgersweier, was completely
destroyed when the latter was declared to be mentally
afflicted. In short, the tragic adventure which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
overtaken d’Auerweck seemed to have been the result
of the most vexatious misunderstanding; at least, that
is what his cross-examiner expressed to him when he
left him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You can now consider your case to be finished, and you can see
how it is possible to find one’s self compromised by unfortunate
coincidences, <i>without any one being to blame</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Encouraged by this assurance, the Baron suffered
patiently in spite of the passing of much time. He
knew that he was not forgotten at the Grand Duke’s
Court. Dalberg, the Ambassador, had already managed
to convey to him some money, with which to defray the
first expense of his visit to the Temple, and yonder, at
Elgersweier, Madame d’Auerweck was in receipt of
assistance from Carlsruhe; for, as a matter of fact, the
mother, grandmother, and children, robbed as they
were of the head of the family, had been suddenly
plunged into the most terrible state of want.</p>

<p>The poor woman, in spite of her condition, desired
only one thing: to obtain a passport so as to be able to
get to Paris. With this object she overwhelmed the
Ambassador of Baden with letters, in which she also
implored him to help to set her husband free.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know that he is innocent, your Excellency,” she continually
wrote to him, “and if your Excellency wants any more proofs of
my husband’s peaceful habits, I will rout out all the available
evidence to prove it. My husband can only benefit by the search
... and I am sure that your Excellency has pity for my terrible
plight and that of my poor little children.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>Dalberg ended by getting annoyed with these letters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I receive frequent epistles from Madame d’Auerweck,” he wrote
to Carlsruhe; “but this <i>wifely impatience</i> is waste of time, because
I can do nothing as long as the presence of the prisoner is necessary
for the conduct of the case.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the mean time, the Baron, by way of killing time,
drew up a second justificatory memorandum, which must
doubtless have staggered Desmarets. In it he exposed
all the hiatus in his cross-examination, and the absence
of any proof against him. Why was it that he was not
set at liberty, now that the falsity of the accusations
brought against him had been so completely demonstrated?
For he had just heard that the Minister of
Police had received a very detailed report, which proved
his residence, in succession, in the Grand Duchy of
Baden from 1798 to 1800, in Offenburg from 1802 to
1803, and in Schutterwald up to September, 1806; it
mentioned his journey to Rothenburg and to Nuremberg
in 1805, and declared that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“wherever the said d’Auerweck had lived, he had always conducted
himself peacefully and with decency, and had never meddled in
politics; that, on the contrary, he had always been occupied with
building, agriculture, botany, and rural economy, which had been
partly proved by many of the papers found upon him at the time of
his arrest.”</p>
</div>

<p>So M. Desmarets and his master were in possession
of an unquestionable justification of the Baron’s protests.
It was, indeed, inconceivable that they would
continue to keep him in confinement, and, what is
worse, without putting any fresh questions to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>However, early in the month of March, 1808—and
d’Auerweck had now been nearly seven months in the
Temple—Baron de Dalberg was informed that Fouché’s
intervention was not enough by itself, and that a pardon
for the prisoner had been submitted to the Emperor,
who was about to leave Paris for a campaign in Spain,
but he had refused to sign it. The situation became
serious. Dalberg fully recognized the difficulty which
he would experience in delivering the unfortunate Baron
from prison; for he was looked upon as “an English
Agent,” and, as such, infinitely more an object of suspicion
than if he had been an emissary of any other
Power. The hatred of England was then at its height,
and Napoleon’s sentiment was that an English spy
deserved to be taken care of, and, indeed, well taken
care of. D’Auerweck could not deny that he had at
one time been in the service of the hated nation; for all
that, he laid claim to being a subject of Baden.</p>

<p>The weeks rolled by, and d’Auerweck began to
despair. He had, perhaps, a momentary glimmer of
hope that his deliverance was at hand, when he became
aware of an unexpected confusion and tumult in the
Temple. What had happened? Was Paris once more
agitated by a change of Government? Had the
Emperor met with defeat? Alas! It was nothing of
the kind. But Napoleon had ordered the Temple tower
to be demolished, and the seventeen prisoners who were
kept there had to be carted off to another lodging.
They were taken to Vincennes, and d’Auerweck’s faint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
hope was blighted. He was more miserable than ever,
and, as soon as he had settled down in his new quarters,
despatched a vehement protest to Desmarets.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What is the reason, in the name of God, that I find myself
dragged from one place to another six months after the arrival of
written statements which ought to have proved my innocence? If
my character had again been blackened by spite, at least give me
the opportunity of fixing the lie. I cannot think that any one in
this world has ever been placed in a more unhappy case than I.
My eyesight is impaired, my health ruined, and my wits are worn
out. I can only think of my unfortunate children, ruined and
deprived of every necessity, and this in the case of a man who is
absolutely innocent of all wrong-doing.”</p>
</div>

<p>It never once occurred to him that his rigorous imprisonment
might be due to some indiscretion connected
with his past and with his conduct in 1795, or with the
part which he had taken in the “Temple affair.” Why
should these old times, which were wrapped in a mist
of obscurity, be remembered? And, besides, there was
no reason for suspecting anything of the kind.</p>

<p>Neither the Grand Duke nor his Ambassador in
Paris relaxed in any degree their efforts to help the
Baron, and a voluminous correspondence was carried on
between Paris and the Court at Baden about him during
the following years; but, to all Dalberg’s demands,
Fouché replied that no one denied Baron d’Auerweck’s
“perfect loyalty;” the matter depended on the Emperor’s
will, and he refused to pass any final order. In order
to soften Madame d’Auerweck’s affliction—for she never
left them alone—supplies were regularly sent to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
prisoner at Vincennes, and he was assured that his
family were not being neglected or in want.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My detention is the outcome of a lengthy series of slanderous
informations,” the Baron declared over and over again, “which has
been woven and pieced together, more or less cleverly, but the
falseness of which has already been demonstrated to those who have
been bribed to utter it.”</p>
</div>

<p>He was then informed that yet another accusation
had been added to the former charges against him: an
accusation of having published in the <i>Moniteur</i>, in 1799,
certain letters dated from Naples, which were insulting
to the First Consul: Now, the <i>Journal Politique de
l’Europe</i> had at once, in the name of d’Auerweck, given
the lie direct to these statements. But what had he to
say for himself?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You know perfectly well, monsieur, that for the last two years,
less ten or twelve days, I have only heard the voice of the Government
through the medium of the bolts which have been shot in
my face.”</p>
</div>

<p>In this way three years slipped by, in the course of
which Madame d’Auerweck (who, by the way, does not
appear to have led a very virtuous life in her husband’s
absence) never stopped pestering the Ambassador of
Baden in Paris with her entreaties; de Ferrette, who,
on his arrival in France, had succeeded Baron de
Dalberg, took up the unfortunate Baron’s case, and
determined to bring it to a conclusion. So as to
increase the authority of his demands, he managed to
interest the Minister of the King of Bavaria on
d’Auerweck’s behalf, and the two combined to present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
a very urgent memorandum, in the summer of 1810, to
the Minister of Police. This was not Fouché, for he
had been degraded for the second time, and his post
was occupied by Savary, the Duc de Rovigo. The
two Ministers made their application to the latter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Yesterday, at this unpleasant ball,” Ferrette wrote on July 2,
“I importuned the Duke of Rovigo to let Lord Auerweck out from
Vincennes; this was just before the Emperor arrived. He said to
me: ‘His case is not unpardonable, but you may rest assured that
we are not keeping him locked up like this without very good
reasons. You must wait.’”</p>
</div>

<p>At last, on October 16, Savary presented to Napoleon
the anxiously-looked-for report, which advised the
prisoner’s discharge. To every one’s astonishment, the
Emperor only made the following observation: <i>Better
keep him until universal peace is declared</i>. There was
nothing to be done but to submit to this merciless
imprisonment, and to accept the explanation which was
given, viz. that d’Auerweck was “a bold intriguer, who
was to be found everywhere: sometimes in the interests
of Austria, sometimes in England’s.”</p>

<p>Afterwards, as though to find an excuse for this
prolonged detention, the Baron was brought in contact
with one of those persons who are known as <i>Moutons</i>;
his line of action was to get on friendly terms with the
prisoner, and to try to get him to talk, the result of
these conversations being handed on to the police. A
man called Rivoire was chosen for this purpose. He
was formerly a naval officer, but had been arrested and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
imprisoned for conspiracy; he escaped, but was caught
and put in prison for the fourth or fifth time. The
“Chevalier de Rivoire” was at the end of his resources,
and hoped to obtain a remission of his sentence by
spying on his companions in misfortune. It was impressed
on him that he must specially pump Baron
d’Auerweck on the subject of the Rastadt assassination.
The two reports, which he sent to Desmarets during
the year 1811, give a rather amusing account of the
success of his enterprise: a success, of course, skilfully
exaggerated.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“D’Auerweck is very suspicious when one begins to put questions
to him, so I adopted the ruse of contradicting him and of only
grudgingly giving in to him. Then, after having started him in
the right direction, if I resign myself to listening patiently, he
obligingly begins to overwhelm me with confidences, both false and
true, and with all the rubbish which his conceit and his insatiate
garrulity inspire in him.... He boasted of having rendered the
most important services to the English, both on the Continent and
in their own country, where he had exposed and baffled many
plots, and had been the cause of the arrest and punishment of many
French agents.... When we began to talk about the Rastadt
affair, he at first repeated the story which had been manufactured
in order to divert suspicion from the real culprits.</p>

<p>“<i>Rivoire</i>: ‘Only children will believe such a fairy tale.’</p>

<p>“<i>D’Auerweck</i> (laughing): ‘That’s true; but we must always tell
it, and by dint of many repetitions they will begin to believe it.
The matter concerns other people’s interests. I only left Austria
when I saw that its Government was fatally weak; so much so that
it has to be treated like a spoilt child that does not want to take its
medicine. Besides myself, there are not more than two people who
are acquainted with the correct details of this affair.’</p>

<p>“Seeing that he had said too much, he then, like a fool, began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
retract, saying, ‘Besides, I was attached to a certain Prince’s
Minister, who was not there with reason, and I was perfectly
neutral in all that happened.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Rivoire concluded by saying, “D’Auerweck was the
leader, or one of the leaders, in this crime, which was
committed at the instigation of the English Government;
and he forthwith went off to give his report; and
he was at this time in London, travelling <i>viâ</i> France.”</p>

<p>These fresh accusations, however flimsy their foundation,
were not neglected, and succeeded in so increasing
the gravity of the Baron’s case that his durance was
prolonged indefinitely. At the same time they served
to maintain the harshness of his imprisonment. Using
the Ambassador of Baden in Paris as the go-between,
d’Auerweck, who declared himself to be seriously ill,
had begged that he might for the time being be sent to
a private hospital, where he could be attended to. But
they questioned whether his illness was only a pretext,
and that he was plotting some plan of escape.
Accordingly the Minister of Police refused his request.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The reasons for the detention of this prisoner,” the Duke of
Rovigo declared to his colleague of Foreign Affairs, “do not admit
of his being transferred to a private hospital. But I have just
given the adequate order that the doctor, whose business it is to
attend the invalids in the prison of Vincennes, should visit this
prisoner as often as his state of health may require it.”</p>
</div>

<p>On May 31, 1812, d’Auerweck was told that no
instructions as to his fate had been given, so, bearing
his troubles patiently, he sent a fresh request, couched
in the following humorous style, to Desmarets:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The regular annual announcement that I am still to be kept in
the dungeon of Vincennes was made to me yesterday; will you
at least have the condescension to pass an order that it may not be
in this celler, in which I have lived for three and a half months.”</p>
</div>

<p>Two more years passed before the tribulations of
d’Auerweck were completed. But in 1814, when the
now victorious Allied Armies drew close to Paris, it was
decided to send the inmates of the prison of Vincennes
to Saumur. How d’Auerweck must have prayed for his
countrymen’s speedy arrival, and that this second change
of residence might be the prelude to his deliverance!</p>

<p>He had not been two months at Saumur when he
heard a rumour that the Allies had entered Paris on
March 31. He was not forgotten in his dungeon, for
three days later the Grand Duke urgently demanded
that his subject might be given back to him, “one of
the many victims of the reign which has just come to
an end;” and the next day the Minister replied that the
order to set the Baron at liberty had been issued three
days ago. April 16 was a day never to be forgotten
by d’Auerweck and his companions. They were
overcome with emotion, as can be guessed from the
following lines, written by Baron de Kolli, the most
extraordinary adventurer of the Imperial epoch. This
person had been confined for four years at Vincennes on
account of an attempt to deliver King Ferdinand VII.
from Valençay, and at Vincennes he no doubt met our
Hungarian. The two of them could exchange their
impressions as captives by the good pleasure of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
Emperor, both imprisoned without trial, and condemned
to an endless captivity, thanks to regular <i>lettres-de-cachet</i>
dug up for this occasion only.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will try, though in vain, to describe this scene, which will be
for ever engraven upon my heart,” Kolli relates. “In the intoxication
of happiness and in tears, each one throws himself upon any
one he meets, and clasps him in his arms; there are forty persons,
all strangers to each other, and in a second they are united by
the bonds of the most tender friendship. As we emerge from our
tombs, the townsmen press around us, and, undismayed by the
sight of our miserable state, drag us to the bosoms of their families.
In a single day we pass from want to opulence.”

Those who witnessed d’Auerweck’s return to Elgersweier,
prematurely aged as he was by these seven years
of misfortune, could hardly recognize in him the
talkative and active man of former days. They all
had a vivid recollection of that night in the month of
July, 1807, when trouble hurled itself upon this family.

<p>However, in spite of confinement and the want of
fresh air, the Barons health was not as severely injured
as one might have imagined. He lived on in his village
for fourteen years, and delightedly took up again the
old tasks of an agriculturist, a botanist, and a husbandman....
In his leisure hours he related episodes of
his strange past to his family and his neighbours, and,
when bragging got the upper hand of him, he recalled
the happy time when he had been raised by Fortune to
the post of “Ambassador to his Majesty the King of
Great Britain!”</p>

<p>He left Elgersweier in 1828 to return to Offenburg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
where he had formerly resided, and there he died two
years later, on June 8, 1830. Three of his children
survived him. Charles, the eldest, had a distinguished
military career; as general in the army of Baden, he
was governor of the fortified town of Germersheim.
Adelaide d’Auerweck lived to be a very old woman, as
she only died in 1881, at Munich. Finally, Armand
d’Auerweck left four children, one of whom, Ferdinand,
emigrated to America, where he is still living.</p>

<p>The descendants of the “little Baron” cherish the
memory of this life, so rich in incidents, so extravagant,
and so surprising; but the part which he played in the
Temple adventure at the time of the great Revolution
would have been for ever hidden had not an unforeseen
chance served to connect him with one of the threads
of this astonishing intrigue, which attracted so much
curious attention.</p>

</div>



<p>We have seen that in spite of the announcement of
the Dauphin’s death, and of all that the Chevalier de
Frotté had written to her on the subject, Lady Atkyns
still held persistently to her conviction that the real
proof of the matter had yet to be discovered, and remained
still determined to solve the mystery. If, as
she continued to believe, the young King had been
spirited away, it might still be possible to find him.</p>

<p>But there were new difficulties in the way. Money,
for one thing, was lacking now, and she knew only too
well how necessary money was. Now, too, she was
alone. To whom was she to apply for assistance? Of
all her old associates, Peltier alone was accessible, and
he was absorbed in his work, as journalist and man of
letters.</p>

<p>Why, she asked herself, should she not seek the help
of a member of the Royal Family of France? The Comte
d’Artois, who had taken in his turn the titles of <i>Monsieur</i>
and of Comte de Provence, since his brother’s proclamation
as King, was living in England. Why not apply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
to him? The ingenuous lady did not think of the very
weighty reasons why such an appeal must be in vain.
Convinced that the Dauphin still lived, she imagined
that she could convert the Comte to her way of thinking,
and induce him to join her in her search after the truth.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the attitude taken up by the British
Government towards her project of inquiring minutely
into the matter on the Continent, Lady Atkyns decided
before leaving England to approach the Comte, hoping
to secure not merely his approval, but also some material
assistance. Had she not sacrificed a large portion of
her own worldly goods for the benefit of his family?
Thus reasoning, she did not conceive the possibility of
a refusal. But <i>Monsieur</i> could not regard as anything
short of fantastic the supposition upon which her project
was based—the supposition that his nephew still survived.
To present this hypothesis either to him or to
his brother the King was to put one’s self out of court
at once.</p>

<p>We can imagine how her application was received.
She chose as her intermediary with the Prince the
Baron de Suzannet, who had facilitated the purchase of
the ships and equipages which were procured in readiness
for the rescue of the Queen and the Dauphin.</p>

<p>Having the <i>entrée</i> to the Court, and being one of the
most notable of the <i>émigrés</i> in London, he consented to
submit his friend’s request to <i>Monsieur</i>. Did he foresee
the issue? Apparently not. Here is what he writes
to her on August 19, 1797:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After the decision <i>M[onsieur]</i> has come to, my dear lady, not
to give his countenance to your affair until it has been taken up by
others, and after speaking to him so often on the subject, I cannot
carry the matter any further, and could not ask him for money.
But I see no reason why you should not yourself write to him more
or less what you have told me, viz. that you were about to return
to France with the consent of the Government, that you ought to
be provided with the same amount for returning as you have been
for going, but that fifty louis is very scant provision for that—especially
considering that you have had to hide yourself away here
so long—and that you are afraid you will not have sufficient to
enable you to remain long enough in Paris to get together all the
particulars required by the Government, and to pay the messenger
for bringing them here; and you might point out that you have
acted throughout entirely in the interests of the Royal Family, that
you do not regret the £1000<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> which your attachment has cost you,
or regret them only because you no longer have the money to devote
to the cause; and that if <i>M[onsieur]</i> for his part could give you
£50, it would free you from anxiety as to ways and means....</p>

<p>“I shall tell <i>M[onsieur]</i> that I am aware you have written to
him, and that I shall convey his answer to you. He has been
taking medicine to-day and can see no one. To-morrow he is to see
some people at the Duc d’Harcourt’s, if well enough. He will not
be going away before Wednesday. His address is 55, Welbeck
Street. I think you would do well to send your letter to him by
hand, sealed and addressed ‘<i>À Monsieur Seul</i>,’ enclosed in an outer envelope
with his ordinary address: ‘<i>Son Altesse Royale Monsieur, frère
du Roi</i>.’ Send me a line to tell me what you have done. <i>Adieu.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>It was not till after a long delay that Lady Atkyns
at last succeeded in meeting the Prince at an inn, only
to meet with a point-blank refusal. But she was not to
be discouraged. The very next day she wrote again to
the Comte asking for an audience. This time it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
another member of his suite, the Bishop of Saint-Pol
de Léon, who replied to her communication—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The moment I saw <i>M[onsieur]</i> yesterday, my dear lady, he told
me about your letter, which gave him great pleasure, though it is a
matter for great regret to him that he is quite unable to do as you
wish, and as he himself would wish. Since his recent attack he
has been unable to dress or go out; he has not been able to receive
any ladies, anxious though he is to welcome those who are here and
who were attached to the Princess. He could not receive one
without its being known, and then he would be expected to receive
a number of others. You know how things get about and what a
close watch is kept on Princes, and how careful our Prince must
be to do nothing that would lay him open to criticism or even to
suspicion. If his stay here were prolonged, and he found he could
see other ladies also, the thing might be managed; but there would
be difficulties even then, in view of your secret being perhaps of a
compromising nature. I am but expressing to you the Prince’s
own views. I hope to see you to-morrow between midday and
three o’clock.”</p>
</div>

<p>The great of this world are never at a loss for pretexts
for refusing requests. <i>Monsieur</i> was particularly
anxious to evade an interview which he felt to be
undesirable, and therefore confined himself to sending
her these amiable phrases.</p>

<p>About the same time M. de Thauvenay, one of the
King’s most devoted courtiers, who happened to be in
London, seems to have promised to use his good offices
with his master on her behalf, telling him of her record
and perhaps of her hopes.</p>

<p>Having exhausted all the means at her disposal in
England, Lady Atkyns saw that she must manage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
her journey as best she could from her own resources,
and resolved to make yet another sacrifice to this end.
She had obtained a considerable loan already once upon
a mortgage on her beautiful estate of Ketteringham.
As this was her only source of revenue, there was no
alternative to raising a further mortgage on it, and
this she managed, though with greater difficulty than
before. (The property was not, in fact, her own at this
time, being entailed on her son Edward.)</p>

<p>She seems to have raised in all about £3000 in this
way in 1799 and the three following years.</p>

<p>Some weeks before the “18th Brumaire” and Bonaparte’s
<i>coup d’état</i>, she set out for the Continent. What
exactly was her purpose? What use was she going to
make of her money? It is impossible to say. To
clothe her errand in the greater mystery, she decided to
land in France under an assumed name, and to veil her
personality under the designation of the “Little Sailor”
(<i>le petit matelot</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I feel I must again send my good wishes for a pleasant journey
to the charming ‘Little Sailor,’” some unidentified friend writes to
her on September 7, “and I cannot too often beg him to bear in
mind that he leaves behind him in England friends who take a deep
interest in his welfare, and who will learn with pleasure that he
has arrived safely at his destination, and, above all, that after fulfilling
his mission he has escaped all the unpleasantness and dangers
to which his truly admirable devotion and zeal will expose him.
I hope one day to prove to the ‘Little Sailor’ how he has long
filled me with the most genuine sentiments—sentiments which I
have refrained from expressing for reasons of which the ‘Little
Sailor’ will approve. I cannot say too often to the amiable ‘Little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Sailor’ what pleasure I shall have in repeating to him in France—and
in France preferably to elsewhere—the assurance of eternal
and tender attachment that I have vowed him for ever and ever.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to know what the “Petit Matelot” did
on arriving in Paris. It was a moment of crisis, for the
Consulate was being established. Most of those who had
been mixed up in the Temple affair were inaccessible,
and yet it was important to get into touch with them
if anything was to be ascertained about the Dauphin.
It would not have done, however, to provoke suspicion,
or Fouché would have been on her track.</p>

<p>Certain only it is that for several months she seems
to have disappeared from sight. At last she was run
to earth and hunted out by Fouché’s agents, and was
obliged to make away to the Loire, where she had
devoted friends.</p>

<p>The Verrière family lived in the country six miles
from Saumur, in Anjou, where many nobles, fleeing
from the storm, had found a safe refuge. The vicinity
of the forest of Fontevrault enabled them to gain the
Vendée, and thus escape the fury of the Revolutionists.
Mme. Verrière had met Lady Atkyns in Paris years
before, perhaps during the golden days of Versailles.
Recalling their former friendliness, Lady Atkyns went
to them in her trouble. The welcome they extended to
her justified her hopes, and she dwelt with them for
some time, until the police had lost all trace of her.</p>

<p>About this period, vague reports began to be spread
about with reference to the imprisonment of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
children of Louis XVI. in the Temple. The obscurity
which had cloaked the last hours of the Dauphin was
still keeping certain brains at work. And a book which
was published in 1800 helped to reawaken public
curiosity. In <i>Le Cimetière de la Madeleine</i>, a romance
written by an author until then little known, Regnault-Warin
deliberately questioned the alleged death of the
Dauphin, and, in fact, based a story of adventure upon
the supposition of his being still alive. Written in the
fashion of the time, full of surprising episodes, and
bristling with more or less untrustworthy anecdotes
touching on the captivity of the Royal Family in the
Temple, this novel had an immense success. If it came
before Lady Atkyns it must have served to stimulate
her anxiety to solve the problem she had so much at
heart.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1801 Lady Atkyns appears to
have addressed herself to Louis XVIII., unwarned by
her failure with <i>Monsieur</i>. In this case also failure
was to be her portion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your letter,” ran the reply, signed by M. de Thauvenay (whom
she had met some years before), and addressed, as a precaution, to
Monsieur James Brown, dated October 2, “would have been
enigmatic to me had I not placed it before my master, who, by a
curious series of accidents, had received only a few days before the
communication you sent him on the 12th of July. In requesting
me to reply to you, monsieur, he charges me to express to you his
recognition of your constant interest and indefatigable zeal for his
welfare, and his regret that he is prevented by his present position
from learning the particulars of the speculation that your heart has
formed, and that he cannot have any share in it.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>Six weeks later Lady Atkyns received a second letter,
despatched, like the first, from Varsovie, reinforcing the
above:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wish,” writes M. de Thauvenay, “that I could convey to you
the deep and tender feeling with which my dear and venerated
master has read these new and touching testimonies of your interest
and friendship, and his deep regret at being unable to enjoy the
consolations that your sympathetic and generous nature has proffered
him! No, monsieur, I swear to you, no other house has offered him
any kind of interest in the speculation you have proposed to him.
I should add that there is no one with whom he would rather have
shared the chances than with you; but his position is such that,
for the moment at least, he can only display passive courage in the
face of misfortune. I need not remind you, monsieur, that the most
appreciative and most generous of hearts has eternal claim upon a
heart such as yours. Never, I feel convinced, will your noble and
moving sentiment be modified by time or place. This conviction
is sweet to me, and it is with the utmost sincerity that I render
you once again my tender (if I may use the word) and admiring
respect.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is not easy at first to understand what M. de
Thauvenay means by this “speculation,” in which the
King refuses to take part. On reflection it seems
probable that Lady Atkyns’s proposal, thus described,
had reference to the affair of the Temple, for it seems
impossible that she should have flattered herself that
she could see a way to the return of the exiled
King.</p>

<p>However that may be, these two letters convinced
her that it would be useless to prolong her stay in
France, and she returned to Ketteringham, after an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
absence of three years, without having effected her
purpose.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two tragic events occurred in the year 1804 to
startle the French who were still taking refuge in
England. The first was the arrest and shooting of
the Duc d’Enghien at Vincennes. If Bonaparte had
punished one of the many schemers who had plotted
against him on English soil, his action would have
found defenders. But this execution of a Prince, who
was absolutely innocent and who had held apart from
all political intrigues, aroused the same kind of horror
that had been evoked eleven years earlier by the death
of Louis XVI. and Marie-Antoinette.</p>

<p>The Prince de Condé, the Duc d’Enghien’s grandfather,
was staying in England at this time, like
<i>Monsieur</i>, the King’s brother, and their residences were
naturally the centre of the excitement over this event.
The Baron de Suzannet describes the state of things in
their <i>entourage</i> in a letter to Lady Atkyns:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It would seem, madame,” he writes to her on April 14, “that
the murder of the Duc d’Enghien has horrified not merely all true
Frenchmen, as was to be expected, but also Englishmen of every
class, the perfidy as well as the cruelty of it is so revolting to all
in whom the sentiment of justice and honour is not extinct. I
shall not speak of the courageous and heroic death of this ill-fated
Prince, but of the condition of his unhappy relatives. Since the
day when <i>Monsieur</i> carried him the terrible news, the Prince de
Condé (save for two journeys to London necessitated by his anxiety)
has not left his room or been down to dinner. Plunged in grief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
he sees no one, and it is much feared that his death may follow
that of the Duc d’Enghien. He loved the Duc as his grandson and
his pupil, and perhaps even more as one qualified by Providence to
add still further to the glory of his illustrious name. The sorrow
of the Duc de Bourbon is not less deep and intense.”</p>
</div>

<p>At the same moment, the news of the arrest of
Cadoudal in Paris, the discovery of his plot, the sensational
trial of his twelve accomplices, together with a
number of insurgents—forty-seven prisoners in all—and
finally the execution of the famous brigand on
the morning of June 25, came to intensify the agitation
of the French in England.</p>

<p>Of these events Lady Atkyns heard particulars from
the Comte de Frotté, father of her friend the General.
Throughout five years the venerable Comte had followed
with joy or anguish the career of his son as a leader of
the insurrection in Normandy. Repeatedly he had come
to his aid with money and encouragement. Suddenly
the fatal bullet had ended everything. Henceforth the
unhappy father had followed eagerly everything that
could bring back the memory of the Chevalier, and he
had been drawn to Lady Atkyns by his knowledge of
the long-standing friendship that had existed between
her and him.</p>

<p>To add to his sorrow, Charles de Frotté, half-brother
to Louis, had been arrested and imprisoned by
Napoleon’s police soon after the execution at Verneuil.
He was kept at the Temple for two years, without
apparent reason, then sent to the Fort of Toux, in Jura.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I learnt yesterday,” writes the Comte de Frotté to Lady
Atkyns, “that my unhappy son has been transferred from the
Temple to a château in Franche Comté. How cruel is this persecution!
How terrible this imprisonment, not only for himself, but
for us who are bound to him by ties of kinship and for his friends.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus Lady Atkyns, though in the seclusion of the
country, far from London and the Continent, remained
bound in thought to her life of earlier days. She had
no one now to love except her son, who was an officer
in the first regiment of Royal Dragoons. Owing to the
delicacy of his health, young Edward Atkyns had been
obliged to go on leave for a time, and his mother
invited the son of Baron de Suzannet to Ketteringham
to keep him company. But the visit did not come off,
and two months later the young soldier died of the
malady from which he had been suffering for some
years.</p>

<p>Two years earlier a somewhat strange incident had
occurred in France. On February 17, 1802, the police
court at Vitry-le-Françoi had to sit in judgment upon a
young man named Jean-Marie Hervagault, charged with
swindling, passing under a false name, and vagabondage.
This individual, arrested and imprisoned for the first
time in 1799, claimed to be the Dauphin, escaped
miraculously from the Temple. The son of a tailor of
Saint-Lo, Hervagault, in the course of his wanderings,
had managed to convince a certain number of people
that he really was the Prince. Public curiosity was
aroused. Many people went to visit the youth in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
prison. To put a stop to this movement, the Vitry
Tribunal condemned the adventurer to four years’ imprisonment.
His trial disclosed the fact that amongst
his dupes were many persons of distinction, including
M. Lafont de Savines. Some weeks later the Vitry
sentence was ratified at Rouen, and Hervagault was
incarcerated in the prison of Bicêtre in Paris. But the
feelings of sympathy and pity that had been called
forth, Hervagault’s assertions and his circumstantial
accounts of the way in which he had been carried off
from the Temple—all these things attracted the more
attention by reason of the appearance a short time
before of Beauchamp’s work, <i>Le faux Dauphin actuellement
en France</i>.</p>

<p>Lady Atkyns was quick to secure details as to the
story of the prisoner at Bicêtre. There were many contradictions
in it that must have come home to her. And
Hervagault mentions the name of the General Louis de
Frotté as that of one of his liberators, whereas, in his
letters to her, the Chevalier had made it quite clear
that this could not be so. However, it seemed worth
her while to write to the old Comte de Frotté on the
subject.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have just received your letter,” he replies, August 16, 1804,
“and I hasten to send you a line. I have spent a whole week
rummaging among papers. I can assure you that what is stated in
the book you have sent me is all fiction. Louis and Duchale are
mentioned in 1802 because they were both dead. I am almost
certain that in 1795 (in the month in question) Louis was fighting
in Normandy, and that he did not leave his companions once all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
that year. But we shall go into all this on your return, and no
doubt will be left in your mind. If you arrive towards the end of
the month, tell me at once. I shall call on you and tell you all
I can, and make you see why I am convinced that this fellow is a
puppet in some one else’s hands.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Atkyns was reluctant to give up the faint hope
that there might be something in this Hervagault
narrative, but after some conversations with the Comte
de Frotté, and after comparing the pretender’s statement
with documents left by the Chevalier, she was at
last convinced that the whole thing was a fraud.</p>

<p>We hear of her again in October, 1809, taking a
prominent part in the celebrations being held in her
neighbourhood in honour of the jubilee of George III.
Then we lose sight of her until 1814, and the triumphant
return to Paris of Louis XVIII. Lady Atkyns hastens
now to secure the good offices of the Duc de Bourbon,
with a view to drawing attention to all her sacrifices
and the sums of money she has expended.</p>

<p>She is delayed, however, over her contemplated
journey to France for this purpose, and Napoleon’s
escape postpones for two years more all hope of
accomplishing her return to Paris.</p>

<p>When at last the monarchy is restored once more,
she finds that her aspirations are destined to be disappointed,
despite all the kind words with which she was
soothed in England, and we find her uttering the word
“ingratitude,” which is henceforth to be so often on her
tongue. There were so many who held themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
entitled to gratitude and recognition at the hands of
Louis XVIII.—<i>émigrés</i> returned to France after twenty
years of sorrow and indignities, and now counting upon
the recovery of their possessions or on being reimbursed
in some way by the act of the Sovereign. What an
awakening they met with when the time came to
formulate their applications and they found themselves
obliged to condescend to the drafting of innumerable
documents, and to put up with interminable delays!</p>

<p>On September 27, 1816, Lady Atkyns writes to her
friend Mme. de Verrière an account of her disappointing
experiences. She had been well received at Court, but
that was all.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The kind of ingratitude I have been meeting with is not very
consoling. They give me plenty of kind words, but nothing more.
I have written a long letter to the man of business, begging of him
to get the employer to reimburse me a little for the moment, but I
have received nothing yet, and this puts me out greatly. Perhaps
something will turn up between now and the end of the week. If
not I must go and see my poor mother and beg to get my affairs
into order.”</p>
</div>

<p>The state of her affairs, for long precarious, was now
giving the poor lady very serious anxiety. By recourse
to various expedients she had managed to hold out
until the return of the Bourbons, and to stave off her
creditors. But she was now at her last gasp. If the
King refused to help her, to “reimburse” her, she was
ruined. The Comte de la Châtre had assured her that
her application was under favourable consideration, that
the King regarded it approvingly, that the Comte de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
Pradel, the head of the King’s household, had it in hand;
but, in spite of this, there was a series of delays.</p>

<p>At last, worn out with waiting, she writes in her
naïve style to the Comte on October 10, 1816—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I beg of you to be good enough to get the King to decide this
matter as soon as ever possible. I must get away to England in
three weeks to see my mother, who is ill, and I can’t possibly do
this until I know the King’s decision in regard to me. I know his
Majesty is too good to injure one who has given so many proofs of
boundless devotion to the Royalist cause and to the entire Royal
Family. Although I have a splendid estate in England, I am now
in great difficulties by reason of this devotion. I tell you all this,
Monsieur le Comte, so that, like the good Frenchman you are, you
may do me this kindness of getting the King to give you his orders.
I have run every conceivable kind of evils during these twenty-four
years. I beg of you to excuse all the trouble I am giving you, and
I have the honour to be, Monsieur le Comte,</p>

<p class="right">
“Your very obedient servant,<br>
<br>
“<span class="smcap">Charlotte Atkyns</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>This appeal seems to have been no more successful
than the preceding ones, for three months later we find
Lady Atkyns still awaiting the promised audience. To
distract her thoughts from the subject, she goes about
Paris—a new city now to her—is present at sittings of
the Chamber of Deputies, and hears the speech from
the Throne. On All Souls’ Day she joins in the solemn
pilgrimage to the Conciergerie. Who could have been
more in place on such an occasion? But with the sad
thoughts evoked by the sight of the Queen’s prison
were mingled regrets that the sanctuary had not been
left as it was. The place had been enlarged, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
massive, heavy-looking tomb stood now where the bed
had been.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I knelt before this tomb,” she writes to Mme. de Verrière,
“but I should have preferred to have seen the prison room
unaltered, and the tomb placed where the Queen used to kneel
down to pray. The place has been made to look too nice, and a
simple elegance has been imparted to it which takes away all idea
of the misfortunes of that time. I would have left the bed, the
table, and the chair. There is a portrait of the Queen seated on
the bed, her eyes raised heavenwards with the resignation of a
martyr. This portrait is very like, especially the eyes, with that
look of angelic sweetness which she had. There is another tomb
with a crucifix on it, as on hers, upon which are inscribed the
words: ‘<i>Que mon fils n’oublie jamais les derniers mot de son père, que
je lui répète expressément; qu’il ne cherche jamais à venger notre mort</i>.’
You go in by the chapel, and behind the altar, to get to where the
Queen used to be.... I repeated on the tomb what I vowed to
the Queen—never to abandon the cause of her children. It is true
that only Madame remains now, but she one day will be Queen of
France, and if she has need of a faithful friend she will find one in
me.”</p>
</div>

<p>These last lines seem a strange avowal. Lady Atkyns
seems to be renouncing her faith. What is the explanation?
It is simple enough. She has realized that as
long as she puts forward her inopportune plea regarding
the child in the Temple she must expect to find
nothing but closed doors. Yet she has by her proofs of
what she alleges, and she is prepared in substantiation
of her memorials to hand over a selection of the precious
letters from her friends which she has received in the
course of her enterprise. These, doubtless, would be
accepted, but would never be given back. What, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
is she to do? Threatened on the one side by the distress
which is at her heels; a prey, on the other hand,
to her inalterable conviction, the luckless lady comes
for a moment to have doubts about her entire past.
However, this disavowal, as it seems, is but momentary;
a calmer mood supervenes, and she returns to her former
point of view, unable ever to free her mind from doubts
as to the real fate of the Dauphin.</p>

<p>The King’s generosity in this year, 1816, does not
appear to have given her much satisfaction.</p>

<p>“At last I have received a little money,” she writes
to Mme. de Verrière just before Christmas, when preparing
to return to England, “but so little that it is
really shameful.”</p>

<p>The following spring she is back again in France,
still carrying on her campaign. From 1817 to 1821
her letters pour in upon the Ministry of the Royal
Household. Did they contain indiscreet allusions to
the affair of the Temple? Perhaps. In any case, with
a single exception, all these letters have disappeared.</p>

<p>We find a curious reference to Lady Atkyns in a
letter dated January 11, 1818, preserved in the archives
of the Comte de Lair—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“She is still in Paris,” says the writer. “For the last two
months she has been going every week! She declares now she will
start without fail on Tuesday morning, but the Lord knows
whether she will keep her word.... She is still taken up with the
affair in question, and passes all her time in the company of those
who are mixed up in it. I assure you I don’t know what to make
of it all myself, but it is certain that a number of people believe it.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>The “affair in question” was the detention at Bicêtre
of an individual about whom the most sensational stories
were current. A maker of <i>sabots</i>, come over—no one
quite knew how—from America, Mathurin Bruneau,
playing anew the Hervagault comedy, had been passing
himself off as the Dauphin. Arrested and imprisoned
on January 21, by order of Decazes, the Minister of
Police, Bruneau had for two years been leading a very
extraordinary life for a prisoner.</p>

<p>He was by way of being in solitary confinement,
but there was in reality a never-ending succession of
visitors to him in his prison. A certain Branzon,
formerly a customs-house officer at Rouen, who had
been condemned to five years’ imprisonment with hard
labour, had become his inseparable companion. With
the support of a woman named Sacques and a lady
named Dumont, Branzon got together a species of
little court round the adventurer, issuing proclamations,
carrying on a regular correspondence with friends
outside, and playing cards until three o’clock in the
morning—finally composing, with the help of large
slices out of <i>Le Cimetière de la Madeleine</i>, a work
entitled <i>Mémoires du Prince</i>. Some unknown painter
executed a portrait of the prisoner as “a lieutenant-colonel
or colonel-general of dragoons,” and a mysterious
baron, come from Rouen to set eyes upon his Sovereign,
took the oath of fidelity to him on the Holy Scriptures
in the jailer’s own room! On April 29, 1817, the
walls of Maromme, Darnétal, and Boudeville, near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
Rouen, were covered with placards calling upon France
to proclaim its legitimate King. And all this happened
under the nose of Libois, the Governor of Bicêtre.</p>

<p>There seems, in fact, to be no room for doubt that, as
has been well said, “in this prison, in which there has
been a constant procession of comtes and abbés, and a
whole pack of women, there has been enacted in the
years 1816-1818 a farce of which his Excellence
Decazes is the author.” The object of this mystification
was simply to baffle the Duchesse d’Angoulême in the
first instance, and to prevent public opinion from being
led astray in another direction. Bruneau did not stand
alone. Six months earlier another pretendant, Nauendorff,
a clockmaker at Spandau, had written to the
Duchesse d’Angoulême to solicit an interview. It was
all important to put a stop to this dangerous movement.
Therefore when on February 9, 1818, the proceedings
were opened at Rouen, no pains had been spared to
give the affair the appearance of a frivolous vaudeville.
On February 19 Mathurin was condemned to five years’
imprisonment. The court was crowded with all kinds
of loafers and queer characters, many of them from
Paris, drawn by the rumours so industriously spread
about.</p>

<p>Lady Atkyns would seem to have given some attention
to this new alleged Dauphin without being carried
off her feet. She lost no opportunity of endeavouring
to get at the truth, it is clear, and this, as we learn
from a police report, involved a number of visits to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
house in which Gaillon was imprisoned, and to which
Bruneau was transferred after his condemnation. It
was even stated that she had offered sums of money to
enable Bruneau to escape. She soon had her eyes
opened, however, to this new fraud.</p>

<p>The accession of <i>Monsieur</i> to the throne, in 1824, does
not seem to have had any favourable result for Lady
Atkyns, for we find her at last reduced in this year to
taking a step, long contemplated but dreaded—the
handing over of Ketteringham to her sister-in-law, Mary
Atkyns, in consideration of a life annuity.</p>

<p>She continues, however, to make her way every year
to France, buoyed up by the assurances of interest in
her which she has received from officials of the Royal
Household. At first she stays with friends, the Comte
and Comtesse de Loban. Then in 1826, when her
mother dies, aged eighty-six, she establishes herself
definitively in Paris, taking up her abode in a house in
the Rue de Lille, No. 65, where she rents a small
<i>appartement</i> on the first floor. Here she gets together
the few souvenirs she has saved from Ketteringham—some
mahogany furniture covered with blue cloth, a
sofa covered with light blue silk, and portraits on the
walls of the Dauphin, his father, his uncle, and the Duc
de Berry.</p>

<p>It was while residing here that Lady Atkyns lived
through the revolution of Italy, after witnessing in
turn the reign of Louis XVI., the Terror, the Empire,
the Restoration, and the reign of Charles X. What an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
eventful progress from the careless, happy days when
she played her part in the dizzying gaieties of Versailles!</p>

<p>Some weeks before the fall of Charles X., Lady
Atkyns drew up yet another petition for presentation
to the chief of the King’s household. She did not
mince her words in this document.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I little thought that lack of funds would be advanced as a
reason for delaying the execution of the King’s orders. I will
not enlarge upon the strangeness of such an avowal, especially
as a reimbursement of so sacred a character is in question,
sanctioned by the Royal will. I would merely point out to you,
Monsieur le Marquis, that I have contrived to find considerable
sums (thereby incurring great losses) when it was to the interest
of France, and of her King, and of her august family. Failing
a sufficiency of money to liquidate this debt, I have the honour to
propose to your Excellency that you should make out an order for
the payment, and I shall find means of getting it discounted. In
your capacity as a Minister to the King, your Excellency will
be able, without delay, to obtain the amount necessary, minus
a discount, from the Court bankers. Will you not deign, monseigneur,
to ask them to do this, and I shall willingly forego the
discount that may be stipulated for.... Finally, monseigneur, I
beg of you to tell me immediately the day and the hour when
I may present myself at the Ministry to terminate this matter. I
must venture to remind you that the least delay will involve my
ruin, and therefore I cannot consent to it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Atkyns’s persistence and the King’s procrastination
seem intelligible enough when one learns that
the sums expended by her, from the time when Louis
XVI.’s reign was projected down to the last year of the
Consulate, amounted to more than £80,000. The
Englishwoman might well speak of the sacrifices she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
had made and the loss of her fortune at the dictates of
her heart.</p>

<p>One other letter we find amongst Lady Atkyns’s
papers—a letter notable for its fine, regular penmanship.
It evidently reached her about this date. The
writer was yet another <i>soi-disant</i> Dauphin, the third
serious pretendant. The Baron de Richemont—his real
name was Hebert—had published in 1831 his <i>Mémoires
du Duc de Normandie, fils de Louis XVI. écrits et
publiés par lui-même</i>, and he was not long in convincing
a number of people as to his identity. He probably
owed most of his particulars as to his alleged escape
from the Temple to the wife of Simon, whom he had
visited at the Hospital for Incurables in the Rue de
Sèvres. Possibly it was through her also that he heard
of Lady Atkyns. At all events, he thought it worth
while to approach her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Revered lady,” he writes to her, “I am touched by your kind
remembrance.... The idea that I have found again in you the
friend who was so devoted to my unhappy family consoles me, and
enables me the better to bear up under the ills that Providence has
sent me. I shall never forget your good deeds; ever present to my
memory, they make me cherish an existence which I owe to you.
I cannot tell what the future may have in store for me, but whatever
my fate you may count upon all my gratitude. May the Lord
be with you and send prosperity to all your enterprises! He will
surely do so, for to whatever country you may take your steps, you
will set an example of all the virtues.</p>

<p>“We shall see you, I hope, in a better world. Then and in the
company of the august and ill-fated author of my sad days, you
will be in enjoyment of all the good you have done, and will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
receive your due recompense from the Sovereign Dispenser of all
things.</p>

<p>“There being no other end to look for, I beg of God, most
noble lady, to take you under His protection.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Louis Charles.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Richemont shows some aptness and cleverness in the
way he touches the note of sensibility, and attains to
the diapason appropriate to the <i>rôle</i> he is playing. Had
his letter the effect desired? It is hardly likely, but it
is the last item in Lady Atkyns’s correspondence, and
we have no means of finding an answer to the question.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the night of February 2, 1836, Lady Atkyns died.
By her bedside one person watched—her devoted
servant, Victoire Ilh, whose conduct, according to her
mistress’s own statement, “had at all times been
beyond praise.”</p>

<p>The few friends who could attend gathered together
in due course to pay the last honours to the dead.
Her remains were conveyed to England for burial at
Ketteringham, in accordance with the wish she herself
had expressed.</p>

<p>Time passed inexorably over her memory, and twenty
years later there was nothing to recall the life of love
and devotion of this loyal and unselfish Englishwoman.</p>

</div>


<p>Not more than two or three generations separate us
from the period through which we have seen come and
go the various actors involved in the enterprise of
which the prisoners in the Temple were the stake. The
<i>rôle</i> that was played by Lady Atkyns and her confidants,
forming as it did a minor episode in the changeful
story of the emigration and of the fortunes of the
Royalists during the Revolution, deserved to be set
forth. But the interest attached to such narratives
becomes greatly intensified the more completely the
records of those mentioned in it can be traced to the
end. It seems well, therefore, to see what became of
the principal performers who have passed before our
eyes in this slight study.</p>

<p>Of Cormier’s two sons, Achille, the elder, disappears
from the scene completely, and all our efforts to trace
him have been in vain. In the case of his brother we
have been more fortunate. Having served as an officer
in the army of Vendée, Patrice de Cormier, from the
moment of the Restoration, sought to return to active
service. Being on terms of intimacy with Prince de la
Tremoïlle, Frotté’s old friend, who was then presiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
over the commission inquiring into the claims of
Royalist officers with a view to according recompense
to them, Cormier petitioned for employment in the
company of light horse. His loyalty was not in doubt,
for a memorandum supporting his application recorded
that “when the allies entered Paris, he secured a drum
of the National Guard by purchase, and beating it in
front of a white flag, made his way through the streets
of Paris.” The “Hundred Days” interfered with his
ambitions, and he was obliged to betake himself to
England, whence he made his way back to France
in July, 1815. The warmth with which Prince
de la Tremoïlle recommended him to the favour of
Louis XVIII. showed what value he attached to his
friendship.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He has accompanied me constantly as my aide-de-camp,” said
the Prince, “on my mission, at the time of my arrest and during
my escape, and he has never failed to give me new proofs daily of
his intelligence and zeal, of his boundless devotion to the King, and
of his capacity. If ever services rendered could justify me in
recommending any one to the favour of the King, this estimable
officer would be the first I should venture to recommend.”</p>
</div>

<p>These words produced their effect. On February 24,
1816, Cormier was appointed “<i>chef de bataillon</i>” in the
first regiment of infantry of the Royal Guard. Three
years later he became a lieutenant-colonel, and as such
he took part in the Spanish expedition of 1823, under
the command of the Duc d’Angoulême. Charged
with the carrying out of an order to the Royal Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
troops before Figuières, he fell into an ambuscade of
thirty Constitutional soldiers, and received their volley
at a distance of a few yards. By a miracle he escaped
with a wound on the hip, and succeeded in fulfilling
his mission.</p>

<p>Promoted to the rank of colonel, November 1, 1823,
Cormier was stationed at the Garrison at Rochefort
at the outbreak of the Revolution of July. Refusing
to serve under the new <i>régime</i>, he sent in his resignation
to the Minister for War, August 5, 1830. This
is the last we hear of him. He died in a suburb of
Paris.</p>

<p>His uncle, de Butler, after living for some time in
Hamburg, where he doubtless was regarded by the
other <i>émigrés</i> with suspicion by reason of his
intimate relations with Bourrienne, Minister to the
Emperor, returned to England, where he is lost sight
of. He died at Gothenburg in Sweden in 1815.</p>

<p>Bereft of his two sons, Comte Henri de Frotté remained
in England entirely alone for a time, but
returned to France on the restoration of the Bourbons,
obtained the rank of <i>maréchal de camp</i>, and died in
Paris, February 28, 1823. An enthusiastic Royalist,
active and keen, the Comte de Frotté had never ceased
to interest himself in the welfare of the <i>émigrés</i> in
England, and came to be regarded as their benefactor.</p>

<p>The career of Jean-Gabriel Peltier was of a more
singular description. This energetic pamphleteer had
been editing in London ever since 1802 a journal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
entitled <i>L’Ambigu</i>, in which he unceasingly vented his
spleen against the “Premier Consul.” His violence went
to such lengths that in 1803, on the reiterated demand
of the incensed Napoleon, he was brought before an
English tribunal. He was defended by the famous
counsel, James Mackintosh, and received only a mild
sentence, with the result that he left the court in
triumph, and attained wide celebrity throughout
Europe over the affair. In addition to his newspaper
work, Peltier was interested in a number of
publishing enterprises, which helped to make a livelihood
for him.</p>

<p>Some years later the Fates made him <i>chargé
d’affaires</i> to the Emperor of Haïti. The amusement produced
by this strange appointment may be imagined.
What made the thing still funnier was the fact that
His Haïtian Majesty paid his representative not in
money but in kind, transmitting to him cargoes of
sugar and coffee. Peltier negotiated these from time
to time for the benefit of his creditors.</p>

<p>On the return of the Bourbons, Peltier returned to
France, hoping, like every one else, for his share of
recompense, but only to be disillusioned. He consoled
himself with the reflection that if his King treated
him like a nigger, at least his nigger (the Emperor of
Haïti!) treated him like a king—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Mais mon nègre a son tour me traite comme un roi.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, the “<i>nègre</i>” soon had enough of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
epigrams, and abandoned him, and this brought about
his ruin. Haying lost all his means of subsistence, he
went back once more to Paris to implore pity from the
King, but in vain, and on March 29 he died miserably
in an attic in the Rue Montmartre, aged sixty-five.</p>

“London, December 10, 1794.<br>
</p>

<p>“Lovers and Ministers who don’t realize their opportunities often
regret them afterwards when they are gone, never to be found
again. This is what I fear is happening to us ... for your
Government is allowing precious days to pass by without profiting
by them, and by its dilatoriness may perhaps lose all the advantages
that are calculated to put an end to our troubles. Could you
believe, dear friend of mine, that it is proposed to put off the
expedition for some weeks!... However, I feel less disquieted
over it all when I reflect that we must have a great many supporters,
and very powerful ones, among those who are playing the <i>rôle</i> of
the enemy, for all these troubles in the interior not to have
produced more effect in the Assembly. Indeed, if some advantage
is not derived from this, those at fault in the matter should be
placed in a lunatic asylum. For myself, without knowing Puisage,
I should certainly give my vote for his being made Constable if he
succeeds in spite of all that can be said, because it will be to him
that the King will be under the greatest obligations. And if any
one were to ask me the name of the woman whom the King has most
reason to love, I should tell him to become my rival, and should
declare that, King though he was, he could never repay the heart
that has suffered so much for him.</p>

<p>“I have seen M. W[indham], and after giving me a number of
evasive replies, at last, on my insisting that I wanted to be off, he
answered rather warmly: ‘Oh, I can send you off at once if you
like; but what do you propose to do? I have nothing definite to
put in your hands. I have others to carry my packets, and I have
no one except yourself to carry out the mission I have in my
mind for you. Do have a little patience, and if you follow my
advice you will be all right. Be sure that I have my eye on you all
the time.’ So you see I am still in this state of suspense. If only
you had been able to remain I should not have found the time so
long. Unable to get away to serve my King, I should have
consoled myself as much as possible in the presence of Madame....”</p>

<p>“I hasten to reply to your despatch, dated the 20th floréal,
which accords remarkably with one I sent you from here on the
21st. It even seems that we have had the same sources of inspiration,
and I shall not be surprised to find that the same Baron
d’Auerweck, whom I denounced to you, had been in his turn the
denouncer of Le Cormier. From the impressions I have been given
of his character and principles, it is quite possible. However that
may be, I have lost no time in having an interview with Colleville,
who had already told me of the arrival of the Bishop of Arras, and
who then further informed me (before he knew what my business
with him was) that this person had written to him yesterday that
his arrival was postponed, and that perhaps it would not take place
at all, on account of the prolonged stay of the King of Verona with
Condé’s army. The King (Colleville assured me) would not leave
this army, as it had been averred that he would.</p>

<p>“I began by telling Colleville that I had had a favourable reply
from you about his affairs. He assured me of his gratitude, and at
once spoke to me of his favourite idea of obtaining permission to
serve you elsewhere than at Hamburg—a very natural desire,
whether one explains it by his conviction that he would play a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
active part somewhere else, or by his possible apprehension that his
relations with us may be in the end discovered.</p>

<p>“I thought it better not to tell the man all I knew. I told him
that before leaving Hamburg he would have to throw some light
upon the things that were going on in that town; and I said
enough to him to explain what I meant and to put him on his
mettle. He replied that he knew nothing whatever of the meeting
I had mentioned; that he was sure that if there was a question of
it, Le Cormier, whom he saw every day, would have told him;
and that the latter had been thinking for some days past of going
into the country with M. de Bloom (who was formerly Danish
Minister in Paris), but that it seemed that he would not now go.
He added that he knew enough of the emigrants at Hamburg to be
certain that, with the exception of Le Cormier, there was not an
enterprising man in the ‘Ancien Régime’ section; that if such a
plan had existed, he thought it was more than likely that the King
of Verona’s change of position would have caused another to be
substituted for it; and that, in any case, he would investigate and
explain, and might depend on his giving me all the information he
could get. He further said that the Prince of Carawey, whom he
knew privately, was expected at Hamburg from Lucerne within
the fortnight, and if there was anything to be learnt from
him, he (Colleville) would make it his business to learn it. I
asked him what Lord Mc. Cartally had come here for. He did not
know. I hope that I shall have found out whether he has left or
not before the courier goes.</p>

<p>“In fact, Citizen Minister, Colleville’s absolute ignorance of the
meeting you speak of leads me to have some doubt of its reality.
But I shall not leave it at that. I have already taken measures to
get hold of my man, and also to have the plotters whom you
indicate to me well watched from other quarters. I am aware that
with men of Colleville’s stamp there is always the evil, if not of
being spied on in our turn—which is easily avoided with a little
prudence—at any rate of being given information with a double
purpose. It was as such that I regarded what he told me of a
general plan of the <i>émigrés</i>, which was to operate in the very heart
of the Republic, and to re-establish the Monarchy by the organs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
the Law itself. He thought himself sure of a man in the Legislative
body (he told me his name was Madier). He knew all the
details of the system they were to follow, and the details of the
prosecution of the 2nd of September were actually to enter into it.
As to the 2nd of September, I answered, every Frenchman regards
it with horror, and the scoundrel ought to be punished. The
Government will certainly take care that an act of justice does not
become an anti-revolutionary instrument.</p>

<p>“Le Cormier has a brother-in-law called Buter (<i>sic</i>), who goes
and comes from Paris to Boulogne, Calais, and Dunkirk, carrying
despatches and money from England. Dr. Theil, who is settled
in London, continues to serve as go-between for the Princes’
correspondence. At Hamburg a man named Thouvent does the
business.</p>

<p>“The prime mover in the new Royalist manœuvres, and the
designer of the plan they are conducting in the interests of the
Republic, is (so Colleville says) the Duc de le Vanguyon. Maduron,
that brother of de la Garre, whom I once denounced to you, said
that he had been arrested once or twice at Paris, and taken before
the police, but that he had got out of it by means of his Swiss passport.
It is certain that the <i>émigrés</i>, when they talk of a journey to
France, do not anticipate any more dangers than if they were going
from Hamburg to Altona. An Abbé de Saint-Far, residing at
Hamburg, has, it is said, a quantity of arms in his house. I told
you some time ago that he had contracted for some millions of guns.
I suppose it was at that time for England. My next despatch,
Citizen Minister, shall contain more positive information on the
matter you desire me to investigate. If the meeting is actually to
take place, I think I shall certainly be able to solve the problem
you suggest to me.</p>

“St. Petersburg, August 14-25, 1797.<br>
</p>

<p>“To-day, dearest Charlotte, is, by the old style, the birthday of
the King of France, and also that of one of his most devoted, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
least useful subjects—myself. This month is one of sad memories.
It was in this month that <i>her</i> birthday also fell; that she left the
Tuileries and entered the Temple prison; indeed, August is filled
with dates unforgettable at all times to the faithful, remembered
the more poignantly when the day itself recalls them. I had your
letter yesterday: it gave me pleasure, dear Charlotte. When I
read it I was nearly asleep, for it was three in the morning, and
I had come back from a stupid ball that I had been obliged to
go to.</p>

<p>“You are always talking to me about a diary, my dear, but I
have not the courage to tell you the wretched history of my life.
I am just a machine wound up. I go on for ever, but without
pleasure or interest in what I do. I live on in anguish, and my
letters would be very doleful if they were a faithful portrait of
myself; but we are so far apart, my dear, you and I, and letters
pass through so very many hands, that we must only guess at one
another’s meaning—we cannot speak out. You know my heart—it
will always be the same, and despite appearances, my feelings have
not altered, I swear to you. But one has to be careful, when one
can’t speak face to face. It is a sacrifice; but who has not sacrifices
to make? How many I’ve made in the last two months! I’ve left
everything to come to a country where I know nobody. Here I am
friendless among strangers; naturally I am criticised, and severely.
All the kindness of LL.MM.II. has aroused great expectations in
society; I feel that, and, shy as I always am, I get shyer and shyer.
But indeed I ought to be grateful, for I am received and treated
with consideration by many people here; they take a pleasure in
showing their admiration for my conduct. My conduct! Ah!
when fate brought one into contact with <i>Her</i>, was it possible to
help adoring her? What merit was there in being faithful to Her,
when one could not possibly have been anything else?</p>

<p>“I am sorry, dear Charlotte, for all the worries that the storm
caused you on shore; to tell the truth, I felt best at sea. Do
believe that I am not a coward, and that I was scarcely frightened
at all. The weather was rough only twice, when we were entering
the Cattegat, before the Sound; I think it must have been a tribute
to the shock caused by the encounter of the two seas. Then on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
Friday, or rather Thursday the 27th, when we were arriving at
Cronstadt, the weather was very bad, and I must confess that that
evening and night I did feel uneasy. It wasn’t cowardice. The
captain himself was anxious, and, indeed, the heavy rain and the
darkness of the night, besides the number of small rocks that stick
out of the water here, and could not be seen at all on account of the
darkness, made our situation pretty serious, I assure you. Thank
Heaven, though, I got on very well. When the captain came to
say we were at anchor, I felt a wonderful gladness, and yet, all of a
sudden, I began to cry, for I could not help saying to myself:
‘Yes, I’m here! And what have I come for? Where shall I find
any friends?’</p>

<p>“Well, Heaven has not forsaken me. If it had not found friends
for me, at any rate it <i>has</i> found benefactors, and I am as comfortable
as I could possibly have expected to be. At Court, while
I stayed there, every one, beginning at the very top, was eager to
show me respect and interest; and, here in the town, many people
help to make my life happy and tranquil. There are little groups
in which I am certain I shall enjoy myself when I am more at my
ease. I am received most cordially and flatteringly; it seems a
kindly, quiet sort of set; every one is eager to be nice to me, and
there are not too many people. Ease, without which there is no
such thing as society, is the dominant note in this set. But,
Charlotte dear, don’t imagine that I’m already devoted to these folk.
I shall never care deeply for any one again, nor make any other
close friendship. It was <i>She</i> who drew us together, Charlotte; my
love for you shall be my last and dearest devotion, I promise you.
Good-bye, my dear; I think of you a thousand times a day; I am
happy now, for I am doing something for you, and to prove my love
for you is one of the ways to make me happy. If you see H.R.H.
the Prince of Wales, lay my respectful homage at his feet, and tell
him that my prayers follow him always. Yesterday I bought a
carriage which is really quite new, and yet it only cost me 115 louis;
I drove to my ball in it last night (about 13 miles from here)
over a pavement that no one could imagine if they had not driven
over it! My dear, in one minute I spent as much money as I did in
the whole of the last year I lived in England. I use only four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
horses, and that shows how moderate I am, for a lady in my
position ought not to have less than six. They threaten me with
having to order the ‘St. Catherine’ liveries, which would cost
1200 roubles, that is, 150 louis. Compare this picture, dear
Charlotte, with that of two months ago, when, with my linen frock
tucked up under my arm, I was going about alone in the streets,
knocking at Charlotte’s door—and now, driving about in my own
carriage, drawn by four horses, with two lackeys behind, dressed out,
feathers in my hair—in short, a lady of fashion! Doesn’t it seem
like a dream, Charlotte? I assure you it does to me; and I assure
you also, my dear, that the idea of coming seemed impossible—this
world is not like the one we lived in then. The sacrifice was
necessary; it had to be made; that was inevitable for both of us.
I believed, at any rate, that I had to make it; and every minute I
congratulate myself on having done so. Adieu! I hope you will
have noticed the date of one of my letters; I am the more particular
about this, since receiving yours of yesterday. Send my letters under
cover to M. Withworth, your Minister here; and don’t let them be
quite so thick, so as not to tax your Government too severely.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“P.S.—A thousand loving remembrances to your mother and
your son. What a mania for marriage you’ve got, all of a sudden,
and where are all your husbands? You hid them very well from me,
for a whole year. I never beheld one of them; and you have two,
my dear! I <i>had</i> a good laugh, I can tell you! What are their
names? And when is either of the two marriages to come off?”</p>

<p class="right">
St. Petersburg, October 15, 1797.<br>
</p>

<p>“I am alone to-day, my Charlotte; a year ago this very day I
was with you; I had the relief of speech, but I could not feel more
deeply than I do now the terrible anniversary which this shameful
day marks for us. At this hour we were on the Richmond Road.
Yes, Charlotte dear, I am thinking sadly of <i>her</i>, whom I loved
more than all the world besides, to whom I would have sacrificed
anything. That thought is my one solace now; that thought stays
with me still, the thought of <i>Her</i>, of <i>Her alone</i>.... It is eleven
o’clock now. Where was <i>She</i> then? I evoke it all—the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
scene, afresh; I have read again the lamentable story of her final
sufferings, and my heart is oppressed—I feel almost crazy—I know
not what I want to say! I assure you, Charlotte, that it makes
me happier to tell you all this; particularly to-day, when I’m so
miserable, my friendship with you is a consolation—ah! you see I
cannot write coherently. I feel so ill I wish I could talk to
somebody, and tell them about myself; but how can I? There is
no one at all to listen to me. For who can understand all that we
feel about <i>her</i>? No one, no one. It’s better to say nothing, and
I have said nothing; I haven’t spoken of the anniversary, not even
to M. de C. If I wasn’t feeling so serious, I’d tell you that he
bores me to death. He’s the most exacting creature in the world,
and I am only sorry that I brought him with me. He has done
not a bit of good here, and he is going back to you. Don’t tell
him that I’ve spoken of him like this; he would be horrified. Now
enough of him!</p>

<p>“For a whole week I’ve been thinking sadly of to-morrow. The
little circle of people I know best were to play a little comedy for
the King of Poland. I thought that the 16th was the day they
had fixed on. The idea came into my head at a party—a supper-party,
on Thursday evening, at the Prince Kowakin’s. I never
like to speak of my feelings and my memories; one must suffer in
silence. I was quite determined not to go, Charlotte; you won’t,
I hope, imagine that I debated <i>that</i> for a moment; but I was
worried, for I didn’t quite know how I was going to get out of it
without saying why. A lady, who is always very very kind to me,
saw by my face that I was unhappy about something. ‘What is
it, <i>chou</i>?’ she said to me. ‘You’re sad.’ I said, ‘Oh no! it’s
nothing.’ ‘But I see you; I see there’s something wrong.’ And
at last I <i>had</i> to tell her.... The little entertainment came off
yesterday. It was charming, but it made me so sad that I could
not hide my sadness. All things of that kind have a most curious
effect upon me quite different from what they have of other people.
Still, I must admit (the Comedy was well acted, by people whom
I see a great deal of), I was interested—very much insulted; and
yet, when it was over, there was nothing but melancholy in my
heart. I came home to bed, and to thoughts of Her and you; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
this morning, I had an immense letter from you which I’ll answer
to-morrow. I have read it; and I was very near being late for a
long long mass—it took two hours. This evening, I had intended
to spend here, all by myself. I refused a supper invitation from a
kind young woman of whom M. de Cl. will tell you; and I meant
to return here. Another lady (the one I mentioned first) sent her
husband to tell me that she was ill, and that she would be alone
and would I not come? So when I had been to a tea-party that I
was engaged for, I did go there, but indeed I was very sad, and
more silent than usual. (How people can treat me as they do in
this country, I don’t know—they are certainly most kind). I was
determined, at any rate, to leave the party before ten o’clock.
They tried to prevent me, but I insisted. At ten o’clock I put
on my gloves, but they said: ‘You shan’t go!’ and at last the
mistress of the house, thinking of what I had confided to her a
couple of days before, said to me: ‘What day is to-day?’... Seeing
that she had guessed, I said, turning away with my poor heart
swelling: ‘Don’t speak to me of the day!’... I came back here
alone to weep for my Queen, and to implore God to make me worthy
to be with her again, and that soon—if he will indeed permit me
to see her again, where <i>she</i> surely is. I have much to atone for—I
feel it, know it; but I <i>do</i> in truth even now atone for much. I
swear to you, Charlotte, I have never dared to put into words with
you what you speak of to me to-day,—and with an ‘<i>again</i>’ underlined.
Do you think that <i>I</i> wished it to be so—tell me, <i>do</i> you?
No, no; Charlotte could never think that! If I <i>did</i> ever tell
you, Charlotte, all that I could tell you, it’s because I love you
with all my heart, and because I’m sad, and haunted by memories....
To-morrow, I shall be alone all day; I won’t see my brother-in-law,
or any one else. My door will be fast shut, and I shall return
to you, and tell you all I am feeling.”</p>

<p class="right">
St. Petersburg, October 16, 1797.<br>
</p>

<p>“The date, my dear Charlotte, will be enough to tell you what I
am mournfully thinking of. I began my day by going to church
to hear a mass for Her; and to listen there to those dear sacred
names of Hers. The mass was said by two Trappists, and I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
very sorry that I had not asked the Abbé to say it.... What
odd incidents there are in the history of our revolution! I await
the portrait with a respectful interest, and I thank you in advance
for all the pleasure it will give me. Ah, my dear Charlotte, what
a sad day! My heart aches so deeply and feels so heavy that it’s
as if I were carrying a load, and if I don’t think clearly, I am soon
enough reminded of everything by the pain of it. I can’t speak of
anything but Her. To-day is mail-day; so I must defer until next
time my answer to your last letter, for I must go and talk about
her to some other friends, who loved her too. I have the dress,
and it’s charming. That’s all I can say about it, Adieu. I love
you for Her and for yourself, with all my heart.”</p>

<p class="right">
St. Petersburg, October 16, 1797.<br>
</p>

<p>“When I stopped writing to you last night, I went to bed and to
rest my poor head. I read for half an hour that lovely romance
of <i>Paul and Virginia</i>. My candle went out. Just like that, four
years ago, some hours earlier—one of the world’s choicest treasures
went out to.... I gave myself up to sad thoughts; I imagined to
myself all that she, so lowly tormented, must have suffered then.
But somehow I fell asleep, and I slept on until the fatal hour when
<i>She</i> must have realized how few more hours were left to her on
that earth where she was so worshipped. All my thoughts were
fixed on her, I lay awake for several hours in great agitation; then
I went to sleep again, and at eight o’clock I was awakened so as
to go to hear the mass where her loved name should fall once more
upon my ears. I set off, accompanied by a French nobleman, whom
I love and esteem, because he regrets his Sovereigns as I do. His
kind heart comforted mine; the time I spent with him instilled
solace into my soul, and I was not so unhappy when I came back
from mass. I constantly read over with him all that I have written,
especially all that I remember <i>her</i> having said in and before the
days of her long martyrdom. He will put it all in order, and
make these fragments as interesting as they ought to be. I was
interrupted in this occupation by a man who belongs to this place,
and whom I met in France, when LL.MM.II. came there to see the
objects of my love and sorrow. This man—whom I like better than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
any other I have met here—has given me a thousand proofs of his
interest in me, which I prize as coming from a heart like his. He
knew the anniversary, and spoke to me reverently of it; he is the
only person I have seen to-day. But my dear Charlotte, I must
shut out all extraneous thoughts and think only that She exists no
more, and that her end was hastened by the villany and foul
revenge of human beings, formerly her subjects, formerly her
worshippers, beings with hearts—no! they had no hearts, since
they shed ... since they put an end to that existence ... when
her rank, her character, her face....</p>

<p>“Last year I was with you all through this day; we wept
together for the Queen of Love; to-day, alone with my sad heart,
I can only write to you. Distance separates our bodies; but our
souls and our thoughts and our feelings are the same, and I know
that Charlotte and Louise are together to-day.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right">
<i>After dinner.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“I dined alone. I ate little, Charlotte. Last year, I dined at
your bedside, and I remember that when our dinner had been
served, you told me an anecdote about the little Prince which made
me cry. This year I did not cry at dinner; but I felt even sadder
than I had felt then. The solitude and isolation, and the want of
intimate friends, made me doubly sad. But I must not let myself
think of myself. A voice ordered me to do as I did and I was
bound to follow it—’twas the voice of Right and Well-doing.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right">
<i>Before going to bed.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“I want to talk to you one moment longer about this sad day,
now that it is wrapped in night’s shadows. The crime is committed,
and I bury it in the bottom of my heart; the memory of it lives
there for ever; but I will speak no more of it, Charlotte. All
to-day I was Her’s alone; I forgot every one else, and I lived only
for my old friends, just as if I were not in Russia at all. M. de
Crussol came while I was at supper, and at half-past eleven he told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
me, without my in the least wanting to know, where he had
supped....”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right">
<i>Morning of the 17th.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“Many things have happened to distract me since I came here,
my Charlotte, as you may see from the fact of my having written
to you on the tenth, 7th August, without noticing the date. I should
never forgive myself for it, if I had really forgotten, if those events
had not been as present to my poor heart as they always are, and
always will be, I should be angry with myself; and I should tell
you the truth quite frankly, even if I were to lose by doing so what
I should not wish to have on false pretences—but that fault (if it
was one) was not through want of heart. No! I can answer for
my heart; it is good and true. Since you wished it, I wish I had
written to you on St. Louis’ day; but I would swear that I never
<i>did</i> write to you unless it was mail-day; and that that was the
first time I wrote to you several days running. The sad circumstance
was certainly enough for one to do something out of the way.
Don’t scold me, if you can help it. You’re really too fond of
scolding. To-day it’s about a watch; the next, about yourself!
My dear, you are very good at curing one of little fancies; you’ve
quite cured me of mine for my little watch, and I no longer think
at all of the pleasure it used to give me; but only of what it
gives you, since it comes from me. You must admit that that’s a
very nice way of speaking about a sacrifice, for I won’t conceal
from you that it <i>was</i> one for me. And as to your watch, Charlotte,
I think the watchmaker must have sold it—I’ve been vainly asking
for it, for the last six weeks. When you write several sheets <i>do</i>
number them....”</p>

<p class="right">
“St. Petersburg, November 6 (1797).<br>
</p>

<p>“Mr. Keith has arrived, my dear Charlotte, and the morning of
the very day of his arrival (Friday) he sent me your letters; and
this evening he sent the case, which I think charming, especially the
top. I assure you that it gave me intense pleasure; but what sacrifice
have you made me—where did you get all that hair? It can’t be of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
recent cutting; there are so few white hairs that I should scarcely
recognize them for those dear tresses. In London you showed me
only a tiny bit. Where did you get these? I thank you most
gratefully for such a sacrifice; I confess that it would have been
beyond me, and so I feel all the more grateful. I’m so afraid of
breaking either of the glasses; the case is so high. I must have
seen her like that, but I do not remember it; the earliest memory
I have of her is seeing her twenty-one years ago at some races; and
I remember her dress better than her charming face. The copy is
very well done, and I have had the pleasure of examining it twice.
It was given to me by artificial light, and next day it seemed quite
different, the daylight improved it ever so much; I thank you a
thousand times. It is the most delightful gift I could have had.
The cameo is very pretty. I imagine it would fain be your portrait,
and is really the portrait of Thor’s daughter; she is rather
elongated, poor little lady, but apparently the qualities of her heart
atone for the defects of her face. My dear, you’re mad with your
‘fashions’! Let me tell you that, except when I go to Court, I’m
just as I was in London, almost always in black-and-white linen
gown. All the women, you know, dress themselves up, if you
please, nearly every day. I never cared about that kind of thing—indeed,
I detested it; and having to dress myself up four times a
week makes me incredibly lazy on the days that, with joy untold, I
can rest from all that bother. My friends are always laughing at
me for my dowdiness—so you see what I’ve come to. As to having
to wear warm clothing in Russia, as you think one has, you are
quite mistaken. Once inside the street door, the houses are so
warm that a very thin dress is by far the best to wear. So muslin
is better than warm materials. One has to wear fur-cloaks, and
well padded ones too, when one is going out, even from one house
to another. That is necessary here; but indoors one would be
suffocated in padded clothes. I used to think the same as you. I
had a dress made in London, and I’ve only worn it once or twice,
and then I thought I would die of heat; so you see it will hang in
my wardrobe for a long time.</p>

<p>“Yes, I like caricatures; why not? I don’t see anything wrong
about them. And I don’t care whether they’re of Bonaparte, or any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
other of those gentlemen. To tell you the truth, I wish they would
do something worse to them than only make fun of them; but now,
with the way Lord Nelson of the Nile has disposed of Bonaparte,
one certainly can have a good laugh at him. <i>He</i> doesn’t carry the
austerity of his principles as far as you do, my dear Charlotte.</p>

<p>“I shall have the inscription of the Queen’s portrait changed;
her name is wrong. It ought to be ‘M. A. de Lorraine, Archduchess
of Austria.’ The portrait is charming, but all the same it
is not the Queen <i>we</i> knew; and I loved her so much better than
when that portrait was done. Adorable lady! She was always
beautiful and sweet. My dear, I’m ashamed to say I’ve forgotten
to tell you that the portrait, though it didn’t come on our day of
mourning, did arrive on November 2, her natal day. I thought of
Her all day long; and when Mr. Keith came, it quite distracted
me, for everything that reminds me of England puts me in such a
state of mind. I talked to him about the case; and he tells me
that he had given it to the captain and begged him to put it in his
pocket, and that he was to see him again in the afternoon. Imagine
my uneasiness and impatience! I made a lackey wait at my house
all day, and about eight o’clock the precious case was brought to me.
I thank you for it with all my heart. I wish I could send you
something as precious, but I haven’t an idea what to send. For the
rest, I haven’t got anything, not even the black glass for my friend.
My dear Charlotte, you will never cure yourself of giving little
<i>coups de patte</i>; you know that I never guess anything; but
still...! That black glass must be for some one who draws, and
since I take the trouble of doing your commissions, it must be for
some one I like. Adieu, my dear! Forgive this small reflection.
But though you’re so used to liberty, you don’t allow me many
liberties, I think. Well, it’s better to give them back than to
have them stolen—and so I do, you see! A thousand kisses!”</p>

“Tuesday, January 1, 1805.<br>
</p>

<p>“Nobody does you more justice than I do, madame; nobody
reveres you more. The devotion which the French people displayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
during the Revolution was no more than their duty. They owed
the sacrifice of their lives to the cause of the restoration of the
Monarchy, and of order to the country.</p>

<p>“But you, madam, a native of England, <i>you</i>, with your feeling
heart, have undertaken for this just cause more than could have
been hoped for from a lady, and a lady who was a foreigner, and
whom nothing bound in any way to our sovereigns, our country,
and our troubles. By risking your life, as you have done several
times, you have acquired a right to the respectful gratitude of all
honourable Frenchmen.</p>

<p>“My own present troubles may make me more unhappy in
certain circumstances, but shall never make me unjust. Appearances
may be against me. On your return I shall open my heart to
you, and you shall judge. All I can say here is, that I have lost
everything. I have a son still, but he is in the enemy’s chains, and
that enemy has means of intelligence everywhere, which informs
him both of what is and of what is not. I ought to be more circumspect
than others; but, all the same, no consideration shall prevent
me from keeping my promises. If I meet unjust men as I go along,
so much the worse for the master whom they serve, and for the
faithful subjects who may have relations with them, particularly in
these critical times. What I now have the honour to write to
you, will be an enigma to you for the present. I will explain to
you when you return, but I think I may presume that your discernment
will have given you an indication to the solution. No,
madam, it was not because the money was not delivered to me at
the time you arranged that I had ceased to ask for it. I remember
very well that you were kind enough to say you would lend the
200 francs which I asked you for, if it was possible for you to do
so. The impulse which moved me in that matter was natural in an
unhappy father, deserted and mourned for by those who ought to
have protected him. I added, in speaking to you then, that I had
inherited some means from my father, which would put me in a
position to be able to pay this debt; but that heritage was in
reality such a small affair I dare not run the risk of embarrassing
my friends if God were to cut short my career. And <i>that</i> is why I
ask you not to do anything further in that affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“Accept my deep regrets for having troubled you at a moment
which must be so painful to you. I have shared your too-just
regrets, and all through my life I shall sympathize with anything
that concerns your affections. It is the natural consequence of
my respectful and undying attachment for the friend of my unfortunate
son.</p>

<p>“My friend assures you of his respect, and of the sympathy he
felt in the cruel loss which you have suffered.”</p>

“January 6, 1835.<br>
</p>

<p>“I, Charlotte Atkyns, give to Victoire Ilh, my maid-servant, at
present in my service, all effects of furniture, linen, wearing-apparel
and silver that I possess; and, generally, all objects which may be
found in my room, in my house, or lodging, at the date of my
decease, whatever they may be; and also my carriage. I give
moreover to the said Victoire Ilh, the sum of £120 sterling, which
is due to me to-day from Nathaliel William Peach, of 13, Saville
Street, London, and of Ketteringham in the County of Norfolk, or
from his heirs, which sum shall be payed on demand to the said
Victoire Ilh, after my decease. I further give to Victoire Ilh the
sum of £1000 sterling, which shall be paid to her within three
months of my death.</p>

<p>“I charge these gifts on the Norfolk property, which is at present
in the possession of the said Nathaliel W. Peach as a guarantee
for all my debts, I having mortgaged the said property in favour of
my sister-in-law, the late Mary Atkyns, for £18,000 sterling, and
in addition for an annuity of £500 sterling payable quarterly each
year; and as in consequence the freehold belongs to me, I charge it
with the payment of my lawful debts, and of my funeral expenses.</p>

<p>“I desire that my body be taken to Ketteringham and interred
in the family vault; and that my name and age be inscribed on
a plain marble stone, near the monument of my late dear son. I
have mentioned in another will the names of some friends from
whom I beg acceptance of some souvenirs of my consideration and
esteem. I give the box which I have left with Messrs. Barnard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
and Co., N. Bankers, Cornhill, London, to Mr. Nathaliel W. Peach.
It contains some pieces of silver. I left it there, I think, on
November 10, 1832. I give the freehold of all my properties in
Norfolk to Nathaliel W. Peach for the payment of all charges and
debts, present and future. I give £100 sterling to my servant,
Jean-Baptiste Erard, native of Switzerland, who has served me
faithfully for five years, and whose conduct has always been regular.
As to that of Victoire Ilh, ever since she came into my service,
it has been beyond all praise. This girl was not born to wait upon
others; she belonged to a very respectable family of Munich. I
appoint Nathaliel W. Peach my executor. I request that immediately
after my death the Counsel for the British Embassy,
Mr. Okey (or whoever may be Counsel at the time) be sent for;
and I desire him to be good enough to act for Mr. Nathaliel W.
Peach here at Paris.</p>

<p>“In the name of God, I sign the present testament.”</p>
